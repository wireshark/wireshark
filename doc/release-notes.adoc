== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

Wireshark is hosted by the Wireshark Foundation, a nonprofit which promotes protocol analysis education.
Wireshark and the foundation depend on your contributions in order to do their work!
If you or your organization would like to contribute or become a sponsor, please visit https://wiresharkfoundation.org[wiresharkfoundation.org].

The TCP dissector no longer falls back to using the client port as a criterion for selecting a payload dissector when the server port does not select a payload dissector (except for port 20, active FTP).
This behavior can be changed using the "Client port dissectors" preference.

Display filters now correctly handle floating point conversion errors.

The Lua API now has better support for comma-separated ranges in different locales.

Wireshark 4.4.0 included the following changes.
See the
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/relnotes/wireshark-4.4.0.html[release notes]
for details:

Many improvements and fixes to the graphing dialogs, including
I/O Graphs, Flow Graph / VoIP Calls, and TCP Stream Graphs.

Wireshark now supports automatic profile switching.
You can associate a display filter with a configuration profile, and when you open a capture file that matches the filter, Wireshark will automatically switch to that profile.

Support for Lua 5.3 and 5.4 has been added, and support for Lua 5.1 and 5.2 has been removed.
The Windows and macOS installers now ship with Lua 5.4.6.

Improved display filter support for value strings (optional string representations for numeric fields).

Display filter functions can be implemented as plugins, similar to protocol dissectors and file parsers.

Display filters can be translated to pcap filters using menu:Edit[Copy,Display filter as pcap filter] if each display filter field has a corresponding pcap filter equivalent.

Custom columns can be defined using any valid field expression, such as
display filter functions, packet slices, arithmetic calculations, logical tests,
raw byte addressing, and protocol layer modifiers.

Custom output fields for `tshark -e` can also be defined using any
valid field expression.

Wireshark can be built with the zlib-ng instead of zlib for compressed file support.
Zlib-ng is substantially faster than zlib.
The official Windows and macOS packages include this feature.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system specific to that platform.
A list of third-party packages can be found on the
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform.
You can use menu:Help[About Wireshark,Folders] or `tshark -G folders` to find the default locations on your system.
