=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Capinfos> is a program that reads one or more capture files and
returns some or all available statistics of each E<lt>I<infile>E<gt>.

The user specifies which statistics to report by specifying flags 
corresponding to the statistic.  If no flags are specified, B<Capinfos> 
will report all statistics available.

B<Capinfos> is able to detect and read the same capture files that are 
supported by B<Wireshark>.
The input files don't need a specific filename extension; the file 
format and an optional gzip compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
L<http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.1.html>
is a detailed description of the way B<Wireshark> handles this, which is
the same way B<Capinfos> handles this.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -t

Displays the capture type of the capture file.

=item -c

Counts the number of packets in the capture file.

=item -s

Displays the size of the file, in bytes.  This reports
the size of the capture file itself.

=item -d

Displays the total length of all packets in the file, in
bytes.  This counts the size of the packets as they appeared
in their original form, not as they appear in this file.
For example, if a packet was originally 1514 bytes and only
256 of those bytes were saved to the capture file (if packets
were captured with a snaplen or other slicing option),
B<Capinfos> will consider the packet to have been 1514 bytes.

=item -u

Displays the capture duration, in seconds.  This is the
difference in time between the earliest packet seen and
latest packet seen.

=item -a

Displays the start time of the capture.  B<Capinfos> considers
the earliest timestamp seen to be the start time, so the
first packet in the capture is not necessarily the earliest -
if packets exist "out-of-order", time-wise, in the capture,
B<Capinfos> detects this.

=item -e

Displays the end time of the capture.  B<Capinfos> considers
the latest timestamp seen to be the end time, so the
last packet in the capture is not necessarily the latest -
if packets exist "out-of-order", time-wise, in the capture,
B<Capinfos> detects this.

=item -y

Displays the average data rate, in bytes

=item -i

Displays the average data rate, in bits

=item -z

displays the average packet size, in bytes

=item -h

Prints the help listing and exits.
