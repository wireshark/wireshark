    GitLab CI: Build RPMs in parallel.

    Our RPM spec runs `cmake --build ... -j1` on Fedora and Rocky. Set
    RPM_BUILD_NCPUS, which increases the `-j` value so that ninja can make
    full use of the system.

    BLF: Fixing the interpretation of SRR and RTR

    This fixes a bug in the canfdmessage64 encoding in BLF that leads to
    CAN-FD frames being interpreted as Remote Frames instead of correctly
    ignoring the SRR flag. Makes canfdmessage encoding more robust as well.

Date:   Thu Oct 20 23:07:23 2022 -0700

    packet bytes: don't assume the unadorned "char" type is signed.

    The C language does not guarantee that "char" is signed or unsigned; it
    just states that it's "implementation-dependent".

    At least some C compilers for some architectures make it unsigned, so
    you need "signed char" to get a signed value.  In particular, it's
    unsigned for most ARM compilers (compilers for Darwin-based OSes such as
    macOS make it signed on all platforms, including ARM), which causes a
    warning about "ba[i] < '\0'" always being false.

    The purpose of that test is to check for octets that correspond neither
    to ASCII printable characters nor ASCII control characters; just test
    with !g_ascii_isprint(ba[i]) && !g_ascii_iscntrl(ba[i]).  (Those are
    macros, so it's not as if that adds any subroutine call overhead.)

    Add some comments to explain what's being done in
    ShowPacketBytesDialog::symbolizeBuffer() while we're at it.  (Not one of
    the better uses of C++ polymorphism, giving "replace the octet at this
    location with this sequence of octets" and "replace all octets equal to
    this value with this sequence of octets" the same name, even though what
    they do differs significantly.  I would have called one replace_at and
    the other replace_all or something such as that, but the Qt developers
    didn't ask me....)

    PER, asn2wrs: Fix permitted-alphabet constrained character strings

    Effective permitted-alphabet constraints are only PER-visible for
    the known-multiplier character string types (X.691 27.1). When
    PER-visible, the upper bound of any code point used in the
    alphabet needs to be calculated, in particular for the ALIGNED
    variant, because that determines whether or not canonical order
    is used (X.691 27.5.2, 27.5.4).

    Note that even with the change to asn2wrs.py none of the generated
    dissectors change, because we don't have any example of ASN.1
    with non-PER visible permitted alphabet constraints because of
    using them on non known-multiplier character string types
    (like UTF8String).

    There's some various edge cases that we still don't handle, but
    nothing that any of the ASN.1 modules in the repository use.
    (Permitted-alphabet constraints using characters outside the
    ASCII range, possibly with "CharacterStringList", "Quadruple",
    or "Tuple" notation, permitted-alphabet constraints that are
    extensible and thus not PER-visible, etc.)

    Also fix a fencepost error with the length of the octets to highlight.

    Fix #18468

    Qt: Properly truncate our FieldInformation strings.

    As the Qt6 QString::QString(const QByteArray &ba) documenation says:

    "Note: any null ('\0') bytes in the byte array will be included in this
    string, converted to Unicode null characters (U+0000). This behavior is
    different from Qt 5.x."

    Make sure FieldInformation::toString() truncates its display label byte
    array before converting it to a QString.

    As of a change many years ago, Boolean values are stored as 64-bit (the
    change was made to handle Boolean bitfields in 64-bit fields).  Fix the
    extractor for Boolean values to fetch from the 64-bit unsigned integer
    field, and, while we're at it, add a change that the field in question
    really *is* a Boolean field (the functions used to fetch the value in
    the other extractors do such a check).

    gsmtap: fix dissection of LAPD-in-E1-in-GSMTAP traces

    When the ability to dispatch GSMTAP E1/T1 frames to the LAPD dissector
    was merged in August 2020, a recent July 2020 change earlier has
    restructured and renamed the lapd dissector.  So at the time the GSMTAP
    support for LAPD was added, the dissector was no longer called 'lapd'
    and hence it never worked.

    Qt: Don't use obsolete signal in DCE-RPC/ONC-RPC SRT

    QComboBox::currentIndexChanged(QString) has been marked
    obsolete for a while and finally removed in Qt 6 in favor
    of currentIndexChanged(int) and currentTextChanged(const QString)

    Use QComboBox::currentTextChanged(const QString) instead.
    Also do a little bit of checking to see if the return value
    of dcerpc_get_proto_sub_dissector is NULL.

    Fix #18319.
