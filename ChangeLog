    Qt: update to QCustomPlot 1.3.2
    
    QCustomPlot 1.3.1 includes a fix for a crash ("Fixed potential crash in
    QCPGraph::pointDistance if getScatterPlotData returns empty list").
    Full changelog: http://www.qcustomplot.com/release/1.3.2/changelog.txt
    
    The new files are based on QCustomPlot-source.tar.gz (1.3.2) with
    Alexis' typo and license header changes from v1.99.2rc0-479-gc411029a3c
    ("Update to QCustomPlot 1.3.0") applied. All successive Wireshark
    patches up to v2.5.0rc0-854-g6f28f1a59e ("Fix MacOS build") were
    applied. The Retina patches ("Fix QCustmPlot retina problems." and "QCP:
    Fix retina label calculations.") gave conflicts due contextual changes
    which I resolved by renaming newCachedLabel to cachedLabel (following
    the change in upstream commit baaad24706187f5be0a68011c780b51c4de11558).

Date:   Mon Jul 16 13:17:27 2018 +0200

    wmem: make wmem_strsplit behave more like g_strsplit
    
    In the past "g_strsplit" users were converted to use "wmem_strsplit" to
    avoid memory leaks when dissection fails. The semantics were slightly
    different though. When the DNS dissector tried to split the string "."
    using delimiter ".", it would previously (unexpectedly) receive an empty
    vector (and crash). Now it will receive a vector with one element.
    
    Additionally, suggest that users of wmem_strsplit with a NULL allocator
    use g_strsplit instead, otherwise it will leak the elements.

    Qt: make "Save As" in Follow Streams usable
    
    For formats other than "Raw" and "UTF-8", the written file does not
    match the actual stream data. It would be duplicated in strange ways.
    Executing the "Save As" action twice while the dialog is open would also
    write two different files (huh?).
    
    As a quick fix, just replace the strange save logic by writing the text
    field contents. A functional difference is that previously it would
    write data while parsing the "follow data" list, now it uses the text
    field contents. That data will now be truncated after 500 MB.

    tcp: ignore zero-length payloads for Follow TCP Stream
    
    In the Qt Follow TCP Stream dialog with the ASCII mode, sometimes
    selecting the first few bytes would wrongly select a packet with a
    higher frame number.
    
    This happens because Qt iterates through the list of payloads, then
    stores appends the payload data and maps the new cursor position to the
    packet number. If the payload data was empty, then it would overwrite
    previous cursor positions.
    
    To fix this, do not add records for empty TCP payloads.

    tcp: fix Follow TCP Stream for overlapping data
    
    When two segments overlap each other, previously the second segment
    would wrongly be appended to the first one while it should only append a
    subset from the end of the second segment. (It is assumed that the very
    first segment is received in time such that an extension on both the
    left and right side of the previous stream is not possible.)
    
    Make sure that "frag_follow_record->data" uses a subset (starting at the
    end of the previous stream) instead of the full tvb contents. While at
    it, add some documentation and restructure the logic to avoid code
    duplication and unnecessary memory allocations.
    
    (From bug 9882:) Tested with hao123-com_packet-injection-filtered.pcap,
    it now ignores the new overlapping data. Likewise for overlap-2.pcap.
    Tested with retransmission_with_additional_payload.pcapng (bug 13700).
    Unfortunately, there is no extra expert info to warn about the
    non-matching overlapping segment data, but that is a separate issue.

    Qt: fix wrong Follow Stream text position after changing mode
    
    When switching from ASCII to other modes (such as Hex), the previous
    text to packet number mapping was not cleared. This resulted in
    using the wrong packet number when hovering over the packet data.

    Follow Stream: ensure linear performance with many packets
    
    Reverse the payload chunks list to achieve a running time of O(n) rather
    than O(n²) for insertion of all chunks. Executing a RelWithDebInfo+ASAN
    build with `tshark -r chargen-session.pcapng.gz -qz follow,tcp,hex,0`
    previously took 11m5s to complete, but now finishes in 16 seconds.
    
    Tested using a capture file with 152k TCP packets (from bug 11777).
    Backport note: must update ui/gtk/follow_stream.c too.

    Don't use QFileInfo()::baseName().
    
    It strips off all suffixes, which is not useful behavior; it assumes
    that nobody uses "." for any purpose other than separating a file name
    from an extension - 1994 called, they want their version of Windows
    back (and UN*X called, too...).

    Fix the calculation of a file's "basename".
    
    Strip off only extensions that correspond to file types we know about;
    QFileInfo::baseName() strips off *all* extensions, where "extension" is
    "anything preceded by a .", so it turns foo.bar.pcap.gz into foo, not
    foo.bar.  We don't want that; instead, we strip off only those
    extensions that correspond to file types we know how to read, so we'd
    strip off .pcap.gz in foo.bar.pcap.gz, and strip off .pcap in
    foo.bar.pcap, leaving foo.bar in both cases.

    displaying, those are used for setting the main window's file name and
    for generating names of files to save based on the capture file name.
    
    Have fileDisplayName() just return the display name, without
    "[closing]"/"[closed]" decoration or a special case for no file being
    open (just return a null string if there's no file open), and have
    fileTitle() return the decorated display name.

    Don't show temporary file names in title bars.
    
    For dialogs and auxiliary windows, if we have a live capture that hasn't
    yet been saved to a permanent location, there's no good reason to show
    the temporary file name in the title bar, as:
    
      it's a random string that doesn't indicate where the capture was done
      and that could confuse people (see, for example, the confusion in bug
      14929, in which somebody referred to the "Follow TCP Stream" window as
      the ".pcap dialog" because its title had ".pcap" at the end, due to
      the capture file being a temporary file and its name showing up in the
      title bar of that window);
    
      it differs from what the main window title bar shows.
    
    While we're at it, don't assume that the file name in the capture_file
    structure is a UTF-8 string - some UN*Xes might not use UTF-8 for file
    names.

    Qt: fix crash on opening a capture file while loading/saving another
    
    Closing a capture file while it is being loaded will result in a crash.
    As a workaround, disallow closing the capture file. The requested action
    (e.g. MainWindow::openCaptureFile) will be silently ignored.
    
    While at it, protect process_specified_records (called when saving
    files) similarly to cf_read and fix a crash that occurs when a capture
    from the Capture Dialog is started while a file is being loaded:
    
        file.c:360:cf_close: assertion failed: (cf->state != FILE_READ_IN_PROGRESS)

    file: fix packet list update after dfilter change during live capture
    
    During live captures, "cf->state==FILE_READ_IN_PROGRESS" holds and as
    such setting "cf->redissection_queued" from "cf_filter_packets" will
    prevent the packet list from being updated (no new packets are added and
    display filter changes are not applied).
    
    Fix this by not checking "cf->state" and instead perform an explicit
    check to detect the "update_progress_dlg" issue (see original commit).
    As "cf->read_lock" is implied by "cf->redissecting", remove that check
    as well (see "rescan_packets").
    
    Print a warning instead of aborting in "cf_read" since I am not sure if
    that condition is currently prevented by its callers.

    Fix debugging code.
    
    Don't show address or ports that aren't provided; this is especially
    important for address 1, where its absence is indicated by the pointer
    being null, so we can't blithely dereference it.
    
    Show ports as unsigned, because that's what they are.

    file: do not perform recursive redissections to avoid crashes
    
    When packets are being read (in "cf_read") or rescanned/redissected (in
    "rescan_packets"), it could call "update_progress_dlg". That could end
    up accepting GUI actions such as changing profiles (which triggers a
    redissection via "cf_redissect_packets") or changing the display filter
    (which triggers another "rescan_packets" via "cf_filter_packets").
    
    Such recursive calls waste CPU and in case of "cf_redissect_packets" it
    also causes memory corruption (since "cf->epan" is destroyed while
    "cf_read" tries to read and process packets).
    
    Fix this by delaying the rescan/redissection when an existing rescan is
    pending. Abort an existing rescan/redissection if a new redissection
    (due to profile changes) or rescan (due to display filter changes) is
    requested and restart this to ensure that the intended user action is
    applied (such as a new display filter).

    TRANSUM: fix crash when switching profiles
    
    "output_rrpd" is NULL when the TRANSUM dissector is disabled (which is
    the default behavior). When switching to a profile where the dissector
    is enabled, redissection happens, but without invoking the init routine.
    This leads to a crash when dissect_transum tries to query "output_rrpd".
    
    Fix this by creating the map unconditionally. Use wmem_map_new_autoreset
    since its contents should be erased for new capture files.

        gui.filter_expressions.label: Not-Junk
        gui.filter_expressions.expr: tcp.flags.reset==1
        # note: missing label preference
        gui.filter_expressions.expr: dns
    
    While at it, do not duplicate the filter expression,
    "filter_expression_new" has always been copying it.

    CMake: try to fix duplicate qm builds on Windows
    
    The Windows buildbot showed that .qm files are generated twice. This
    resulted in rebuilding i18n.cpp, which resulted in rebuilding qtui,
    which finally resulted in Wireshark.exe being built twice for no reason.
    
    Assuming it is the same issue as commit v2.3.0rc0-3078-gaa9a0b3bf8,
    avoid having multiple targets depend on the same output (.qm files).
    This patch requires CMake 3.1 or newer.
    
    For master-2.6 backport, limit the change to WIN32 platform (as we already
    require CMake 3.7 as minimum).

    BGP: Validate length of Path Attribute records.
    
    Bug 13741 showed a case where the BGP dissector's failure to validate the
    length of the Path Attribute record allowed a pathological BGP UPDATE packet to
    generate more than one million items in the protocol tree by repeatedly
    dissecting certain segments of the packet.
    
    It's easy enough to detect when the Path Attribute length cannot be valid, so
    let's do so.  When the condition arises, let's raise an Expert Info error in
    the same style and format as used elsewhere in the same routine, and abandon
    dissection of the Path Attributes list.
    
    With this check in place, an incorrect length computation is revealed at a
    callsite.  This would only have prevented a small (less than 5 bytes) Path
    Attribute from being dissected if it was at the very end of the Path Attributes
    list, but the bounds checking added in this change makes this problem much more
    apparent, so we fix the length computation while we're here.
    
    Testing Done: Built wireshark on Linux amd64.  Using bgp.pcap from the Sample
       Captures page on the wiki, verified that the dissection of the UPDATE
       packets were unaltered by this fix.  Using the capture attached to bug 13741
       (clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-6689222578667520.pcap), verified that the
       packet no longer triggers the "too many items" exception, instead we see
       an Expert Info for each oversized Path Attribute length, and eventually an
       exception for "length of contained item exceeds length of containing item".
       30,000 iterations of fuzz test with bgp.pcap as input, and many iterations
       of randpkt-test too.  Crafted a packet with a 3-byte ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path
       Attribute at the end of the Path Attributes list; Before this change, an
       exception is raised during dissection, but after this change it is dissected
       correctly.

    CMake+macOS: Allow the use of ENV{CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}.
    
    If we find /usr/local/opt/qt5, pass it as a PATHS option to find_package
    instead of adding it to the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMake variable. This
    allows setting a Qt path via the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable.

    Add some length checks, remove a DISSECTOR_ASSERT().
    
    Do more checks to make sure we don't run past the end of the data we're
    handed, and don't do a DISSECTOR_ASSERT(), as there may well be packets
    that don't have enough data to pass the assertion - that was causing
    some errors to show up in the 2.6 buildbot when doing 802.11 decryption
    tests.  Those errors should instead be reported as "sorry, we can't do
    decryption" errors by the decryption code.
    
    (XXX - the 802.11 *dissector* should probably be extracting the relevant
    fields and doing the relevant checks, and hand the data to the
    decryption code, so that we don't duplicate 802.11 frame parsing with
    code that might not do as much necessary work as the 802.11 dissector.)
    
    Tweak some comments while we're at it.

    Wiretap imposes an arbitrary limit on the maximum packet size, to

    Clean up handling of counted blobs of bytes.
    
    Don't treat the count+blob as itself a blob of bytes; use FT_NONE.
    Create it with an unknown length (-1, meaning "to end of packet, for
    now"), and set its length once we've finished dissecting it.  Dissect
    the raw bytes of a prefixed-bytes item regardless of whether we're
    building a protocol tree or not.
    
    This means we do a better job of handling a too-large length; instead of
    overflowing the offset, we throw an exception and stop dissecting, so we
    don't run the risk of looping infinitely.

    dependencies at compile-time.
    
    There is no noticeable speed difference between the Python and C implementation.

    Improve the secondary error messages for pcap errors.
    
    On Windows, if WinPcap isn't installed, warn about that for errors other
    than failed attempts to start capturing.
    
    On HP-UX, if we appear to have an old version of libpcap, warn about
    that for errors other than failed attempts to start capturing.
    
    If we know the error is a permissions problem, don't make suggestions
    appropriate to other problems.
    
    If we know the error is *not* a permissions problem, don't make
    suggestions appropriate to permissions problems.
    
    For permissions problems, or possible permissions problems, on Linux,
    suggest doing dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common if you've installed from
    a package on Debian or a Debian derivative such as Ubuntu.

    If device->active_dlt = -1, show "Unknown" rather than "DLT -1".
    
    It means we don't know the active link-layer header type - probably
    because the device can't be opened, so we can't get the default linktype
    or the list of available linktypes - so show it as "Unknown".

    Throw an exception if they don't correspond to data available in the

    Ask why we try to handle a null pointer passed as the string argument,

    Correctly handle the PPI GPS timestamp fraction
    
    The timestamp and timestamp fraction are processed in one step,
    since this creates a proper timestamp interpretation. There are
    two fixes to this code to deal with erroneous packets.
    One is that when taking into account the timestamp fragment the
    available data must be 8 bytes in total, not just 4.
    The other is that when the mask indicates that there's only a
    timestamp fraction, nothing was shown.

    the protocol tree *wasn't* being generated, so proto_tree_add_string()

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Jun 3 10:13:20 2018 -0700

    Fix handling of guintvars.
    
    1) A value that fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer may take more than 4
    octets - the uppermost bit of the octet is a "more octets follows" flag,
    so 4 octets contain only 7*4 - 28 bits of value, so a fifth octet
    preceding that with the upper 3 bits zero could result in a value that
    fits in 32 bits, and further octets of 0x80 just add further leading
    zeroes.
    
    We should, instead, check for *overflow*, meaning that if we add more
    bits at the bottom, the result is *less* than the previous value.
    
    2) When the result overflows, we should clamp it a UINT_MAX, rather than
    setting it to zero, and should keep accumulating octets, so that we
    return the correct octet count.  That prevents infinite loops where the
    item's length, and the item itself, are considered zero-length.
    
    This should fix bug 14738.

    ber: clamp BER lengths to avoid integer overflow
    
    Many callers treat the length as signed integer, so ensure that the
    length fits in such a number. Failure to do so can have unintended
    consequences (such as calling "tvb_memdup(tvb, 0, -1)" and assuming that
    the length is actually 2^32-1).
    
    Although an exception could be thrown as well, let's give the caller a
    chance to handle this themselves.

    Qt: select a better default Decode As table
    
    USB has three possible tables, usb.device, usb.product and usb.protocol

    (integer zero). In such cases it seems more reasonable to use tables for
    which a valid selector exists (for example, "usb.device").

    androiddump: Fix tcpdump encap type when libwiretap is used
    
    androiddump determines encap type by parsing pcap global header from
    tcpdump binary output. Only when libpcap is used with androiddump
    this (pcap linktype) value can be used right away. Libwiretap
    uses its own encap values but is feed with pcap linktype values
    making the whole packet encapsulation invalid.
    
    Fix by converting pcap linktype values into wiretap encap values
    
    (For pcap linktype definitions see http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html)
    (For wtap encap defininitions see wiretap/wtap.h)

Date:   Sun May 27 19:42:35 2018 -0700

    Make sure the offset doesn't overflow.
    
    It'd only overflow if the value is *so* large that it won't fit in the
    packet (given that we have a 2^32-1-byte limit on the packet size), so
    use tvb_ensure_bytes_exist() to ensure we have the entire value before
    processing the value.
    
    (The real problem is that we don't handle the case where there's a value
    multiplicity > 1 for some types; in those cases, we should loop,
    processing all the values, which would cause us to eventually throw an
    exception when we ran past the end of the packet.  This is just a quick
    fix.)

    Fix STUN-over-SSL/TLS/DTLS.
    
    Different dissectors are required for protocols running atop SSL/TLS and
    protocols running atop DTLS - SSL/TLS provides a byte-stream service, so
    there's no guarantee that there's a correspondence between SSL/TLS
    application data record boundaries and packet boundaries, but DTLS
    provides a datagram service, with packet boundaries corresponding to
    application data record boundaries.
    
    This is similar to the difference between dissectors for protocols
    running atop TCP and protocols running atop protocols such as UDP.
    
    So have two separate tables mapping Application-Layer Protocol
    Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs to dissector names - one for SSL/TLS and
    one for DTLS.
    
    There are both "over a byte-stream protocol" and "over a packet-oriented
    protocol" dissectors for STUN and TURN ChannelData packets.  Register
    the "over a byte-stream protocol" ones by name, and use the appropriate
    ones in the appropriate tables.  (There is not one named "stun", so the
    STUN dissector wouldn't have been called at all.)

    rnsap: fix use-after-free of "obj_id"
    
    dissect_PrivateIEFieldValue could use "obj_id" after it was freed. Use
    per-packet info instead of globals to avoid such dangling pointers and
    erase any previous state to avoid interference in the same packet.

    Do IP address resolution synchronously before printing in TShark.
    
    Otherwise, the first N packets printed, for a value of N dependent on
    various factors, won't get IP addresses resolved to names, even if the
    user wants them resolved.  Unlike Wireshark, which, when a name is
    resolved in asynchronously, can go back and fix up the displayed packet
    when the asynchronous operation completes, once TShark has written
    packet data to the standard output, it can't go back and fix it if it
    did name resolution asynchronously.

    That way, if the attempt to create the protocol tvbuff throws an
    exception, we won't leak the protocol representation string, as we won't
    even try to allocate it.
