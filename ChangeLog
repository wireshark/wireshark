commit 23bb4de5c9
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Apr 2 18:03:30 2018 -0700

    If we're reading from a string, don't fclose yyin.
    
    yyin is initialized to stdin.  When we're reading from files, we set it
    so that it points to the FILE from which we're reading, but when we're
    reading from a string, we don't set it, leaving it to point to stdin.
    
    This means that, just as the "read from the input" routine has to be set
    differently when reading from a file or a string, the "close the current
    input" routine has to be set differently as well.

    Don't rely on "xxx *yyy[N] = {};" compiling.
    
    At least as I read C90 "6.5.7 Initialization" and C99 "6.7.8
    Initialization", there must be at least one "initializer" in an
    "initializer-list", so nothing requires that the compiler accept, for
    example
    
            static const ws_mem_usage_t *memory_components[MAX_COMPONENTS] = {
            };

    Don't register the link-layer 802.11 dissector in the gre.proto table.
    
    That dissector expects to be handed an 802.11 pseudoheader; the GRE
    dissector passes no data to subdissectors registered in the gre.proto
    table, which the 802.11 dissector will treat as an "FCS presence
    unknown" indication, even though it's known to be absent.
    
    Use the no-FCS 802.11 frame dissector instead.

    Fix another leak, which happens with -E occurrence=l.
    
    For each occurrence, if there was already an occurrence in the array, we
    were just removing it. not freeing what it pointed to.
    
    While we're at it, expand comments. and always check the array size with
    "!= 0", not "> 0" - the value is unsigned, so they're equivalent, but
    this makes the code more self-consistent.

    mp4: limit the recursion depth for boxes
    
    Although the dissection of each box header consumes a couple of bytes,
    it turned out that it's still possible to crash wireshark with a sample
    file that contains a large number of nested boxes. The stack will fill
    up before we reach the end of the data bytes.
    
    Keep track of the recursion depth as we walk through the hierarchy of
    boxes. Abort if we reach the (locally defined) upper limit.

    Don't handle various "command to send" values in the default case.
    
    The default case ignores the high-order bit, which is set in all the
    values for "command to send", so they will never be matched.  The values
    moved out of the default case, if their upper bit is clear, either don't
    correspond to any command in T.30 or correspond to an initial
    identification command, which never has the upper bit set, so there's no
    risk of misidentification by processing all of the "command to send"
    values outside the default case.
    
    Thanks and a tip of the Hatlo hat to Visual Studio Code Analysis for
    catching this one.
