    Qt: Add missing multi-field column validation
    
    GTK already has it, but Qt forgot about it, so multi-field custom column
    works ok if previously saved in GTK-shark. Invalid validation prevent from
    modifying and saving multi-field custom column in Qt version.
    
    This is a manual merge from 9bb3f6be without the field -> fields change.

    We don't know when the capture started or ended (the time stamps of the

    started or ended), we don't know how many packets were dropped in the
    capture process, and we don't know how many packets were seen in various

      At least Win 10 is violating the spec on rekey by setting the secure
      bit in #2. Unpatched version shows and handles #2 as #4, breaking
      decoding after rekey.
    
    - fixed eapol rekey key handling
      Inital patch (see https://code.wireshark.org/review/8268)
      is adding redundant keys, since it scans all the time
      and not only once.
    
    - ignore tailing garbage after eapol sections in frame
      See https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9065#c8
    
    Included testcase to test decode for incomplete handshakes and eapol2
    packets with secure bit set on rekey.

    Add bounds checks and fix a length argument.
    
    Before reading the record header of a REC_FRAME{2,4,6} record, make sure
    the record length is >= the length of that header.
    
    Whe calling fix_pseudo_header(), pass the actual length of the packet
    data, not the remaining length of the record (which may include
    padding), so we don't read past the end of the packet data.

          the Chunk Type, Chunk Flags, Chunk Length, and Chunk Value fields.
          Therefore, if the Chunk Value field is zero-length, the Length
          field will be set to 4.  *The Chunk Length field does not count any
          chunk padding.*
    
          Chunks (including Type, Length, and Value fields) are padded out
          by the sender with all zero bytes to be a multiple of 4 bytes
          long.  This padding MUST NOT be more than 3 bytes in total.  The
          Chunk Length value does not include terminating padding of the
          chunk.  However, it does include padding of any variable-length
          parameter except the last parameter in the chunk.  The receiver
          MUST ignore the padding.
    
          Note: A robust implementation should accept the chunk whether or
          not the final padding has been included in the Chunk Length.
    
    so the the chunk is *not* required to include the length of the final
    padding in the chunk, although any padding *between* variable-length
    parameters in the chunk must be included in the length (obviously, as
    it's part of the chunk data).

    Clamp zooming so that we don't get zero or negative font sizes.
    
    Those are obviously wrong.
    
    Also, clean up some stuff left over from the GTK+ 1.x days; GTK+ 2.x
    doesn't expose raw XLFD font names, it lets you specify a font by name
    and size, and font_zoom() doesn't determine whether the font is
    resizeable - it just constructs a new font name/size pair and leaves it
    up to its callers to try to load the font, so "there's no such font as
    Wingdings Gothic" and "you can't blow up Fraktur to 10 million points"
    both show up as errors loading the font by name.

    Qt: restore conversation coloring rule shortcuts
    
    GTK+ had this very useful Ctrl+1 .. Ctrl+9 shortcuts for conversation
    coloring rules. Add this functionality to Qt too.
    
    Ctrl+0 is not ported though, this now means "Restore zoom" which is
    quite logical. Also, Ctrl+= (shortcut in GTK+) somehow does not work in
    Qt 5.5.1 (it is detected as Ctrl++ instead).

    CIP: Ensure that all generated data is properly flagged as Generated and no lengths are set for it.
    
    This ensures:
    1. Generated data shows inside brackets [], so it's obvious that the data was actually generated.
    2. Clicking on generated data should not highlight bytes in the packet. Previously, this would sometimes highlight parts of the response packet that were unrelated.
    3. Fixes some assertions that hit in PDML exporting code, due to wrong data locations being referenced.

    Qt: various fixes to VoIP calls / RTP player windows
    
    - Flush any remaining tapped packets before emitting captureFileRetapFinished().
      This ensures that all packets have been treated before returning from retapPackets().
    - Remove VoIP tap listeners when captureFileRetapFinished() is emitted.
      This avoid summing stats each time the RTP player is opened, leading to wrong
      information in VoIP calls window
    - Change voip_calls_tapinfo_t redraw member from a boolean to bitmap so as to identify
      which tap should call the tapinfo->tap_draw() callback. This allows fixing a race condition
      where the RTP player can be empty in Qt UI
    - Reset some more statistics in voip_calls_reset_all_taps()

    myself are wont to do).

    In our case this means that if the sum of our recent column widths

    the last column to fit.
    
    Disable setStretchLastSection. We want its behavior when our columns are

    there.

    Qt Frames: Use ButtonBox instead of buttons
    
     In these frames the Ok and Close buttons are implemented
     as standalone buttons. This leads to the scenario, that
     they break plattform-ui preferences on the one hand, as
     well as not being the same order throughout.
    
     This patch replaces all Ok/Close buttons with the Qt
     button box, which handles the plattform-ui internally, and
     additionally allways enforces the same order.

    Qt: write number of decoded bytes in the RTP player temporary buffer
    
    For codecs using compression (so not G.711) the number of decoded bytes is different from payload len * sample bytes.
    This result in a truncated audio buffer and inaudible audio.

    Bugfixes for EtherNet/IP and CIP
    
    EtherNet/IP
    1. Only decode 32-bit header if there is enough data. Previously, this would show malformed data, even for I/O packets that have no data, eg: heartbeat data.
    2. Typos
    
    CIP
    1. Many Time Sync attribute responses were flagged incorrectly as malformed.
    2. Create service response highlighted the instance number incorrectly, and showed warnings.
    3. Set Attribute List Request should exit early if it doesn't know about a particular attribute.
    4. Incorrect format for Safety Network Segment: Router Format.
    5. Typos

    Qt: reload after applying parameters in UDP multicast dialog
    
    Noticed this message in stderr, started investigating:
    
        QObject::connect: No such signal MulticastStatisticsDialog::updateFilter(QString&,bool) in ui/qt/multicast_statistics_dialog.cpp:247
        QObject::connect:  (sender name:   'TapParameterDialog')
        QObject::connect:  (receiver name: 'TapParameterDialog')
    
    Verified that after this patch, the "Max Burst" changes from "4/100ms"
    to "1/1ms" when modifying "Burst measurement interval (ms)" from 100 to
    1 using rtp-norm-transfer.pcap from the SampleCaptures wiki.

    Fix crash in UDP Multicast Streams dialog
    
    Attempting to open the UDP Multicast Streams dialog in the GTK UI
    triggers an instant crash (heap-buffer-overflow).
    
    Déjà vu. This is the same problem that plagued the RTP Streams dialog.
    This patch is based on the fix in v1.99.3rc0-33-g2c65b33
    (mcaststream_dlg_update confused GList vs. mcaststream_tapinfo_t).
    
    After fixing that, the dialog crashed shortly after setting parameters
    (heap-use-after-free). That fix is based on v1.99.10rc0-292-gb02a0ee
    (after a retap, the old items were still present in the list).
    
    Just that change was not enough as clearing the list still triggered a
    signal, possibly because of the "changed" signal (while the RTP player
    uses a selection setter function). Apply the patch based on
    v1.99.10rc0-270-g01bd832 (disable selection while clearing).

    autotools: do not apply CFLAGS in reverse order
    
    Fixes false "-Wvariadic-macros" because "-Wpedantic" came after
    "-Wno-variadic-macros". While at it, avoid (unintentionally?) adding
    -fPIE to all C++ programs (via CXXFLAGS).
    
    Availability of flags is checked by appending a flag (in case the user
    has something like CFLAGS=-Wno-error).
    
    This removes a -fPIE check for CXXFLAGS and removes 5
    -Woverlength-strings and 9 -Wvariadic-macros warnings from make with
    Clang 3.7.0. configure and compile times were equal. (A diff between the
    configure outputs showed no other changes.)
    
    This reverts commit cf0d762d7304aa569ea25faf999c74bbe94f9023 and applies
    a different approach.

    Don't allow the "Ethertype" pseudo-protocol's dissection to be disabled.
    
    It's not a real protocol, it's a helper dissector for various protocols,
    and it makes no sense to disable it; doing so means that the Ethertype
    field itself isn't disabled, and allowing it to be disabled means that
    you can't do "Disable All", and manually enable Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6,
    and TCP to disable dissection of protocols running atop TCP on Ethernet.

    Qt: Use correct column width when switching profile
    
    QTreeView::setColumnHidden() saves column width on hide and restores
    column width on show.  When switching from a profile with hidden
    columns to a profile where this columns are shown we get a
    sectionResized() signal with the saved width from the old profile,
    initiated from columnsChanged() -> setColumnVisibility().
    We must avoid setting this as a new column width because this is
    recent values from a old column layout.
    
    In other cases we use setColumnVisibility() we don’t need to set
    a new column width either, because we store the column width ourself.
    
    Don't store column width when hiding column (new_width == 0).
    Restore column width when showing column because profiles may have
    changed the packet_list layout.

    Qt: Redissect packets when changing profile
    
    When changing profile the protocol/dissector preferences may change
    so we need to redissect according to new settings.
    
    We should probably have a preferences diff to check if a redissect
    is needed, like it is in the preferences dialog.

    Fix buffer overrun in zlib decompression
    
    After updating next_in (to remove the gzip header), avail_in must also
    be updated. Failing to do makes zlib read past the input buffer. In
    theory this would resukt in a buffer overrun of at most double the input
    length, in practice zlib returns as soon as the compression fails (after
    reading a few bytes).

    epan: Free pointers to deallocated memory
    
    When redissecting packets we call epan_free() which deallocates
    wmem_file_scope memory.  Such memory may be used in proto_data for
    the currently selected packet (cf->edt) and leaves pointers to
    deallocated memory (cf->edt->pi.fd->pfd).  Free them after
    epan_free() to avoid unintended usage in packet_list_clear().

    Do not expand packets in packet dialog by default
    
    Do not expand the packet tree in the packet dialog by default, it
    results in forgetting the previous collapse state and deviates from
    previous GTK+ behavior. It is just annoying to have all Frame, Ethernet,
    etc. trees expanded while you are just looking at application layer
    traffic.
    
    (The previous tree is restored when calling ProtoTree::fillProtocolTree
    which calls proto_tree_draw_node and then invokes setExpanded()).

    Fix RTP player crash on invalid streams
    
    On Linux with pulseaudio, the RTP player can crash when an invalid RTP
    stream is played. Prevent that by detecting when stream playback fails.
    
    Since the stateChanged signal receiver is registered on the same
    thread, it is guaranteed that any outputStateChanged calls happen before
    returning from audio_output_->start().
    
    GTK+ not have this issue, its player simply does not show the decoded
    stream at all.

    Qt: Fixed column issues when changing profile.
    
    Always initialize prefs.col_list in pre_init_prefs.
    When switching to a profile without a saved 'preferences' file we
    have to initialize prefs.col_list to default values to avoid reusing
    settings from the profile we leave.
    This was introduced in 5012cf84e6d84a448171dac64c14d9c83e3d4ae6
    
    Emit columnsChanged() before preferencesChanged().
    This because columnsChanged() rebuilds cap_file_->cinfo which is used
    in preferencesChanged() to align columns (and possible other actions).
    Doing this in the wrong order will give an inconsistency and a
    heap-buffer-overflow if having different number of columns.
