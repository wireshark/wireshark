Date:   Mon Dec 1 08:43:26 2025 +0100

    SMTP: Make sure the line is long enough for a BDAT chunk size

    Make sure that linelen is large enough (i.e., more than 5 octets, for
    bdat-cmd   ::= "BDAT" SP chunk-size
    ) before calling it a BDAT command and trying to call strtoul on
    line + 5 to find the chunk size.

    Fix #20883

    The sample file above didn't crash in 4.6 and earlier because
    tvb_get_ptr was used, which provides a raw pointer into the packet,
    so the strtoul call happened to poke into the CR LF at the end of
    the line in the original packet data, past the ostensible length
    retrieved by tvb_get_ptr(). (In pretty much all implementations,
    even composite TVBs, tvb_get_ptr() never truncates the pointer it
    returns, so the CR LF was always there. Still smells bad, though.)

    MEGACO: Handle tvb_get_uint8 returning -1

    When dissecting a media descriptor, handle tvb_get_uint8 returning
    -1 when searching for a left or right bracket and not finding it
    by setting the bracket offset to the end offset so that the loop
    will exit. Leaving it at -1 can cause going backwards and at worst
    infinite loops.

    This should fix

        CID 1675032:         Integer handling issues  (INTEGER_OVERFLOW)
        >>>     Expression "sequence_of--", where "sequence_of" is known to be equal to 0, underflows the type of "sequence_of--", which is type "unsigned int".

    The same applies to "elements--".

    Make the type of "elements" just unsigned, as dlms_get_length() returns
    an unsigned.

    HTTP3: Put a limit on the maximum bytes decoded in a header

    If we decompress more than 1 MiB in a single header block (field
    section) stop decompressing and add an expert item. Note that nghttp3
    limits the maximum size of a single field. We might want to make this
    maximum configurable via preferences. (The number of headers shouldn't
    matter after 9139917bd8e2c80a5db7079993d5528db74e3519 except insofar
    as they increase the total size.)

    See also #12077 for HTTP/2.

    wiretap: add a separate public header file for wiretap modules.

    For built-in and plugin modules that handle file formats, have a
    wtap_module.h header that declares what they need, and move everything
    intended for use by modules from wtap-int.h to that header.

    Make it public, for the benefit of third-party plugin modules.

    The only stuff remaining in wtap-int.h is for use by code internal to
    Wireshark.

    Do some "include what you use" - and some "don't include what you don't
    use" - work, and update a long-out-of-date comment,  whie we're at it.

    fc00/cjdns: Remove variant Base32 algorithm, do not decode key

    Cjdns/fc00 uses a custom Base 32 variant with a different alphabet
    than that specified in RFC 4648. It's not appropriate to offer it
    as "the" base32 implementation in libwsutil. (An API that offered
    several implementations and the ability for a custom alphabet might
    be useful.) Remove it from libwsutil.

    The implementation submitted is lifted verbatim from the Cjdns
    codebase without attribution, and changing the original license
    from GPLv3 to GPLv2. It had never been licensed as anything other
    than GPLv3 according to the git history of that file in cjdns.
    The Wireshark contributor is an author on the fc00 project, but
    is not clear that the proper rights were obtained to relicense
    the code which originated in cjdns. Remove it, and add the key
    in encoded form instead of decoding. If someone cares, they can
    offer a clean room implementation of the algorithm.

    Update the URL from a mirror of cjdns to the main GitHub repository.

    Fix #20754
