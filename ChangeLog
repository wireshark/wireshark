    SIP: Ignore probable keep alives

    If we have payload on TCP with a single octet that is not printable ASCII,
    just reject it rather than waiting for the next CRLF line end (and
    marking it as Continuation Data then). It is more likely to be a TCP Keep
    Alive at the beginning of a capture file or connection.

    At best, this change means that a correct SIP request or response is
    interpreted rather than marking as Continuation Data. At worst,
    Continuation Data has one less non printable octet at the beginning.

    Fix #18411.

    directory to wsdg_src/images. Copy common_graphics/* to the each images
    directory and remove common_graphics. We only have five admonition

    Qt: Fix click to packet on OverlayScrollBar

    Fix the calculation of the ratio for converting a packet number
    to the scrollbar value by accounting for the length of the slider.
    maximum() does not correpond to the last packet; it corresponds to
    the first packet shown when the scrollbar is at maximum. The last
    packet is maximum() + pageStep().
    (See https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qscrollbar.html#details)

    The quarter of a page padding should be subtracted, not added,
    from the calculated position.
    (Fix up 422c0f45d497872a963363132ec92d400a79538f)

    This correctly makes clicking on the a line in the minimap scroll
    the packet list so that the corresponding packet is 25% of the
    way down the visible window. (Excepting the cases of packets at
    the very beginning or end of the entire packet list.)

    XML: Do escape ASCII control characters

    XML 1.0 allows valid UTF-8 characters, except for the ASCII control
    characters other than tab, carriage return, and line feed.
    (It does not allow form feed and vertical tab, so the allowed group is
    not the same as the standard ctype.h isspace category. It also
    allows but discourages DEL (\x7F).)

    The characters cannot be included as character references of the
    form &#xx; either; there is technically no way to include them.
    Escape them as done prior to 89e96c1e77a39a259cafb488c6057e6c123d692b
    but continue to leave bytes with the high bit set alone so that
    UTF-8 printable characters are not escaped.

    RTP Stream Dialog: Actually sort on packet loss

    The packet loss column has been sorting on a private variable
    that is never set(?!) and also is unsigned whereas the actual
    lost number is signed. Get the calculated packet loss number
    and sort by that. (Should this be sorting by the total number or
    the percentage, since the column displays both? Total number is
    first so let's use that.)

    This should probably be some kind of Model/View instead.

    Qt: Clear selection, not current, in drawCurrentPacket

    QItemSelectionModel tracks both the selected index and the
    current index.

    PacketList redraws when the *selected* index changes, not
    the current index. Clearing the current index, and then marking
    the same packet as selected and current fires currentChanged but
    not selectionChanged. So drawCurrentPacket needs to call
    clearSelection(), not clearCurrentIndex(), in order to trigger
    a redissection of the currently selected packet and update
    the packet details.

    For example, if you mark or unmark the currently selected frame,
    this causes the packet details to update. Cf 52955b9c43a99942b3,
    which fixed the same issue but for Find Packet.

    Fix #14330.
