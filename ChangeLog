    epan: Use a GSequence for tvb_composite and make it non-recursive

    To speed up tvb_composites consisting of many child tvbuffs,
    use a GSequence. This is a data structure that internally has
    a balanced binary tree. It differs from GTree in that one can
    do initial insertions without sorting. In our case, the ordering
    at the time of tvb_composite_finalize is *the* ordering, and is
    the same ordering that comparing according to the calculated
    end offsets will have, so this is faster on insert than a GTree.

    Like a GTree, it is much faster O(log N) vs O(N) on lookup to find
    the location of the TVB with end offset greater than or equal to
    the desired offset than using a GQueue.

    Also, make composite_memcpy iterative instead of recursive, which
    removes the current hard limit of 500 without causing stack overflow
    with very large numbers of child TVBs.

    The file in #20860 works fine now but there could still be limits
    imposed (at least on the total number of bytes?) for a compression
    bomb more similar to the file found in #12077.

    BT L2CAP: Fix reassembly of I-Frames

    For the first fragment, [try to] copy only what is in the fragment,
    not the entire reassembled SDU length, which will fail. (It will
    fail on only the first pass, creating a mysterious expert info that
    doesn't show up in the Expert Info dialog.)

    Fixes reassembly of the I-frame SDUs beginning in frames 76 and 79
    on the capture file in issue #2241; they are ultimately reassembled
    into one OBEX packet in frame 81 which is correctly dissected now.

    DFS: Fix VolumeState bitmap

    pidl, or at least the Wireshark module, doesn't handle a bitmap using
    values from a enum defined elsewhere in the IDL. It's been incorrectly
    interpreted "DFS_..." as the hexstring "DF" and then bailing out with
    errors at the "S":
    Illegal hexadecimal digit 'S' ignored at /builds/wireshark/wireshark/tools/pidl/lib/Parse/Pidl/Wireshark/NDR.pm line 253.

    Fix that by using the actual value.

    EPAN: Have proto_tree_add_bits functions set correct FI bit offset

    Proto_tree_add_bits functions have their offset in bits, rather than
    bytes. During tree item creation a field_info is created with start at
    the first byte of the bit field. Therefore the bit offset to set in the
    field info should be the remaining bits in the byte, rather than the
    full bit_offset. Therefore pass bit_offset mod 8 to FI_BITS_OFFSET.

    epan: Generate the filter for a FT_NONE frame bytes fallback better

    Use the internal ftypes function bytes_to_dfilter_repr to generate
    the dfilter representation of the frame bytes fallback for a
    FT_NONE field instead of re-implementing it. This eliminates a
    snprintf call, and fixes the case where the byte string is exactly
    length 1 (see 881dec9b90aec4e4c4b7ad25e86ee6b61eac4913 and
    f37c7c4062db513bd4dc6fffa36a0c90c74a4339) by making it consistent
    with other dfilter uses and automatically update if FT_BYTES has
    any future changes.

    Fix #20818. (The filter documentation still needs to be updated,
    though.)

    win32-utils: fetch exception descriptions from ntdll.dll.

    Instead of supplying our own descriptions, and not having a description
    for every exception, load ntdll.dll and get the exception string from
    there with FormatMessageW() and convert it to UTF-8.

    This also means we don't use a static buffer, so win32strexception() is
    thread-safe.
