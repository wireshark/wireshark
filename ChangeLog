    pcapng: set the length of the options item.
    
    It runs up to either the end of the option data or the terminating
    end-of-options option (readers MUST handle lists of options that
    contains an end-of-options option and lists of options that don't).

    ascend: set rec->rec_type.
    
    REC_TYPE_PACKET is 0, so if it's been initialized to 0, and never gets
    overwritten, this fixes code withotu fixing a visible bug, but it should
    be done anyway.

    dfilter: Fix handling of escaped quotes in macros
    
    We can't unescape characters when expanding a display filter macro.
    The escaping must be preserved until the expression is evaluated in
    the display filter engine, otherwise it will likely generate a syntax
    error in the parser.
    
    In the macro body we allow '$' (or any other char) to be escaped
    with backslash (preserving the backslash).
    
    Fixes #17160.

    ftype-protocol: Fix crash when comparing _ws.expert to literals
    
    The ftype-protocol has two components to its value - a tvb, which is
    allowed to be be NULL (most notably in _ws.expert), and a string
    description. They can also be created from string literals, such as
    in display filters. It's possible to compare protocols with a NULL
    tvb with protocol terms created from literals, e.g. entering the
    display filter "_ws_expert < 1".
    
    Partially revert 69e2603c48d04a675785d9e7bad162ebb9a83b07 so that
    this doesn't crash, by assigning proto_string to the empty string
    instead of null when creating from a literal. Fixes #17316

    k12: plug a memory leak.
    
    If the two putative number-of-records values don't match (meaning one of
    them is presumably the number of records and the other one isn't - we
    don't know which is the case), free up the private data structure we
    allocated before returning an error.

    OID handling: fix a memory leak.
    
    There's a "break" in some code that appears to be copied and pasted from
    a switch statement; the break would exit the loop (and leak memory
    allocated within the loop), which does not appear to be the intent, so
    it may have been copied over incorrectly.  Remove it.
    
    While we're at it, redo the "constant-time append to the end of a loop"
    code to be a bit clearer, both to humans reading the code and code
    analyzers reading the code.

    If cf_export_specified_packets() succeeds, and it wrote to a temporary

    Plug a memory leak.
    
    If the user aborted the process of exporting packets, if we're writing
    to a temporary file, we unlink the file, but we don't free the

    protobuf: close a leak when file loading fails.
    
    Free the path we've constructed before returning a failure indication if
    pbw_load_proto_file() or load_all_files_in_dir() reports a failure.
    
    Also, explicitly compare pbw_load_proto_file()'s return value against 0,
    to make it a little clearer that it's *not* a Boolean, it's a return
    code (with 0 meaning success and different non-zero values meaning
    failure; if it matters *which* failure it is, we should probably have
    otherwise we should just make it a Boolean).
