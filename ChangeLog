Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon May 20 23:02:39 2019 -0700

    Fix format_uri().
    
    It was using the same index into the input and output strings, which
    means that if it escaped any character, it would skip the next two
    characters in the input sring.
    
    It was also not clearing is_reserved before testing whether a character
    was reserved, so once it saw a character that neede dto be escaped, it
    would escape all subsequent characters.
    
    It was only used in get_key_string(), which was never used, so it was
    dead code, but let's at least fix it, even if we end up removing that
    code, so that if we bring it back, we bring back a non-broken version,
    and so that if anybody *else* uses it, it's not broken.

    In pcapng_open(), don't use the local pcapng_t once we know it's a pcapng file.
    
    Use the local one *only* while we're trying to determine whether we have
    a pcapng file or not; once we know we have a pcapng file, and have
    allocated a pcapng_t and attached it to the wtap structure, pass *that*
    one to pcapng_read_block(), so if it changes anything in the pcapng_t,
    it changes the one we're using.

    Fix the length of the item added for the value field of undissected CLVs.
    
    The length variable is the length of the value, not the length of the
    entire CLV, so there's no need to subtract the length of the C and the
    L from the length - it covers just the V.

    Qt: use toLocalFile() instead of path() to check for existence.
    
    path() incorrectly gives paths as /C:/Program Files/Wireshark/udpdump.html
    under windows. The leading slash gives a wrong test on the file. Instead
    toLocalFile() handles it correctly. isLocalFile() has been used to get if
    we have a local file or a network URL. The reported bug occurred under Windows
    only, but the change is compatible with Linux paths as well.
    
    Accidentally when the test on the file was successful, nothing got called.
    The routine has been reworked to open an existing local file.
