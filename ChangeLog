    Fix bug 9021: 'RTP not decoded inside the conversation in v.1.10.1'
    
    The behavior for SIP/SDP handling of RTP conversation tracking
    changed in v1.10, with some unintended consequences.  The bugs did not
    show up at the time because wireshark makes 2 passes of the packet list,
    and so the problems auto-corrected themselves in most cases.  Unfortunately,
    a change in r53641 modified how UDP behaves, making it always create
    conversations for UDP packets, and that exposed the bugs inherent in the
    SIP/SDP code changes.
    
    This commit reverts the behavior of SIP/SDP to its pre-1.10 model, but
    creates a new preference setting for "Delay SDP changes for tracking media",
    which if enabled, will turn on the new (but buggy) model introduced in 1.10.
    This preference is *disabled* by default, since for a majority of cases the
    new behavior is worse than the previous behavior.
    
    The preference, and this commit's fix, is not intended to last long. I intend
    to re-write the SIP/SDP/RTP interaction model for release 1.11 - I think it's
    too big a change for 1.10, however, which is why I submitted this commit.

    Thou shalt not put newlines in the strings in value_string tables.
    
    That just breaks too many things.
    
    This catches the examples of that found in bug 9878.  There might be
    others that my grepping didn't find.
    
    We should also have the checkAPIs.pl script check for this, so this
    isn't a full fix for bug 9878.

    Always have WS_DLL_PUBLIC include "extern".
    
    This may fix some issues Albert Chin found on Solaris, which might be
    due to variables being defined, not just declared, in header files due
    to the lack of "extern".
    
    Done by backporting some changes from the trunk, but without renaming
    WS_DLL_PUBLIC_NOEXTERN to WS_DLL_PUBLIC_DEF, so that we don't have to
    change any other files.
    
    We also pick up comments from those changes.

    Fix bug 9835 disabled second media stream disables all media streams
    
    When a single media line is rejected in an SDP answer, for example a second
    'm=video' line, wireshark disables ALL media sessions, instead of just that
    one.  But per the RFCs, all it should do is disable just the one RTP media
    session the m= line represents. This commit fixes that, so that a disabled
    media session (one with a m= port of 0) in the SDP answer only disables its
    associated/paired media stream in the offer.
