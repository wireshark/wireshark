%description
Wireshark allows you to examine protocol data stored in files or as it is
captured from wired or wireless (WiFi or Bluetooth) networks, USB devices,
and many other sources.  It supports dozens of protocol capture file formats
and understands more than a thousand protocols.

It has many powerful features including a rich display filter language
and the ability to reassemble multiple protocol packets in order to, for
example, view a complete TCP stream, save the contents of a file which was
transferred over HTTP or CIFS, or play back an RTP audio stream.

This package contains command-line utilities, plugins, and documentation for
Wireshark. A Qt graphical user interface is packaged separately.

%changelog
* Mon Apr 25 2022 John Thacker
- Cleanup specfile to remove obsolete and deprecated syntax

* Wed Jan  5 2022 John Thacker
- pcre2 is required now (most distros will get this as part of a dependency
  chain glib2-devel->libselinux-devel->pcre2-devel anyway)
- Remove Requires that automatic dependency handling picks up

* Mon Mar 29 2021 Joao Valverde
- Update HTML documentation location

* Thu Nov 26 2020 Gerald Combs
- Bison is no longer required

* Tue Sep 29 2020 Lin Sun
- Added opus codec as an option

* Sun Jan 19 2020 Jiri Novak
- Added ilbc codec as an option

* Fri Nov 22 2019 Gerald Combs
- c-ares is a required package

* Thu Aug 15 2019 Gerald Combs
- Add zstd

* Mon Apr 22 2019 Daniel Bakai
- Added brotli (as an option, defaulting to not required).

* Fri Sep 28 2018 Gerald Combs
- Add sdjournal

* Thu Sep 27 2018 Jeff Morriss
- Have the qt package obsolute the old gnome and gtk packages.  This allows
  clean upgrades to the Qt version.
- Set install prefix based on original cmake call's prefix.
- Update capitalization of SUSE.

* Wed Sep 26 2018 Jeff Morriss
- Put development-related files in a new -devel RPM.

* Mon Sep 24 2018 Jeff Morriss
- Allow using ccache to (greatly) speed up rebuilds.

* Mon Sep 24 2018 Jeff Morriss
- Make the (optional) maxminddb dependencies actually work.

* Wed Apr 11 2018 Gerald Combs
- Make documentation installation conditional.

* Tue Mar 20 2018 Gerald Combs
- Migrate from Autotools to CMake.
- Remove Qt4, GTK+ 2, and GTK+ 3 sections.
- Require flex, bison, and libgcrypt.
- Optionally build with Ninja.

* Sat Dec  2 2017 Jeff Morriss
- Include the User Guide (now installed by default by autotools).

* Wed Jul 26 2017 Pascal Quantin
- Added bcg729 (as an option, defaulting to not required).

* Tue Apr  4 2017 Ahmad Fatoum
- Added libxml2 (as an option, defaulting to required).

* Tue Dec 20 2016 Anders Broman
- Add with extcap (as an option, defaulting to yes).

* Mon Dec  5 2016 Jeff Morriss
- Add spandsp (as an option, defaulting to not required).

* Tue Oct 18 2016 Benoit Canet
- Add LZ4 and snappy compression support.

* Mon Aug 29 2016 Jeff Morriss
- Add libnghttp2 (as an option, defaulting to required).

* Wed Aug 17 2016 Jeff Morriss
- wireshark.pc is now installed with Wireshark, include it in the RPM.

* Mon May  9 2016 Jeff Morriss
- Make autoconf, automake, flex, and bison optional: most users (who aren't
  patching Wireshark) don't need them to build an RPM.

* Tue Nov 10 2015 Jeff Morriss
- Rename the gnome package to gtk: Wireshark uses Gtk+ but isn't part of GNOME.

* Mon Sep 14 2015 Jeff Morriss
- Follow ./configure's decision on whether to configure Lua or not rather than
  forcing it to be enabled (and thus failing on some distros which don't ship
  a compatible version of Lua any more).

* Sat Sep 12 2015 Jeffrey Smith
- Begin support for Qt5

* Thu Jan 22 2015 Jeff Morriss
- Add appdata file.

* Tue Jan 20 2015 Jeff Morriss
- Make the license tag more specific: Wireshark is GPLv2+.

* Mon Jan 12 2015 Jeff Morriss
- Modernize the (base package) %%description.

* Wed Dec  3 2014 Jeff Morriss
- Don't run gtk-update-icon-cache when uninstalling the Qt package.  But do run
  it when installing the gnome package.
- Tell the loader where to find our libraries if we're being installed
  someplace other than /usr .
- Attempt to get RPMs working with a prefix other than /usr (now that the
  (free)desktop files are no longer always installed /usr).  Desktop
  integration doesn't work for prefixes other than "/usr" or "/usr/local".

* Fri Aug 29 2014 Gerald Combs
- The Qt UI is now the default. Update logic and prioritization to
  reflect this.

* Mon Aug 4 2014 Jeff Morriss
- Fix RPM builds with a prefix other than /usr: The location of
  update-alternatives does not depend on Wireshark's installation prefix:
  it's always in /usr/sbin/.

* Fri Aug  1 2014 Jeff Morriss
- Remove the old wireshark binary during RPM upgrades: this is needed because
  we now declare wireshark to be %%ghost so it doesn't get overwritten during an
  upgrade (but in older RPMs it was the real program).

* Tue Jul  1 2014 Jeff Morriss
- Get rid of rpath when we're building RPMs: Fedora prohibits it, we don't
  need it, and it gets in the way some times.

* Tue Nov 26 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Overhaul options handling to pull in the UI choice from ./configure.
- Make it possible to not build the GNOME package.

* Tue Nov 12 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Add a qt package using 'alternatives' to allow the administrator to choose
  which one they actually use.

* Fri Sep 20 2013 Jeff Morriss
- If we're not using gtk3 add --with-gtk2 (since Wireshark now defaults to gtk3)

* Thu Mar 28 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Simplify check for rpmbuild's version.

* Fri Mar  8 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Put all icons in hicolor
- Use SuSE's desktop-update macro.
- Actually update MIME database when Wireshark's prefix is not /usr .

* Thu Mar  7 2013 Jeff Morriss
- List more build dependencies.
- Update to work on SuSE too: some of their package names are different.

* Wed Mar  6 2013 Gerald Combs
- Enable c-ares by default

* Thu Feb  7 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Overhaul to make this file more useful/up to date.  Many changes are based
  on Fedora's .spec file.  Changes include:
  - Create a separate wireshark-gnome package (like Red Hat).
  - Control some things with variables set at the top of the file.
    - Allow the user to configure how dumpcap is installed.
    - Allow the user to choose some options including GTK2 or GTK3.
  - Greatly expand the BuildRequires entries; get the minimum versions of some
    things from 'configure'.
  - Install freedesktop files for better (free)desktop integration.

* Thu Aug 10 2006 Joerg Mayer
- Starting with X.org 7.x X11R6 is being phased out. Install wireshark
  and manpage into the standard path.

* Mon Aug 01 2005 Gerald Combs
- Add a desktop file and icon for future use

- Take over the role of packager

- Update descriptions and source locations

* Thu Oct 28 2004 Joerg Mayer
- Add openssl requirement (heimdal and net-snmp are still automatic)

* Tue Jul 20 2004 Joerg Mayer
- Redo install and files section to actually work with normal builds

* Sat Feb 07 2004 Joerg Mayer
- in case there are shared libs: include them

* Tue Aug 24 1999 Gilbert Ramirez
- changed to ethereal.spec.in so that 'configure' can update
  the version automatically

* Tue Aug 03 1999 Gilbert Ramirez <gram@xiexie.org>
- updated to 0.7.0 and changed gtk+ requirement

* Sun Jan 03 1999 Gerald Combs <gerald@zing.org>
- updated to 0.5.1

* Fri Nov 20 1998 FastJack <fastjack@i-s-o.net>
