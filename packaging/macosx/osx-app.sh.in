# USAGE
# osx-app [-s] [-l /path/to/libraries]
#
# This script attempts to build an Wireshark.app bundle for macOS, resolving
# dynamic libraries, etc.
# It strips the executable and libraries if '-s' is given.
# The Info.plist file can be found in the base wireshark directory once
# configure has been run.

# NB:
# This originally came from Inkscape; Inkscape's configure script has an
# "--enable-osxapp", which causes some of Inkscape's installation data
# files to have macOS-ish paths under Contents/Resources of the bundle
# or under /Library/Application Support.  We don't have such an option;
# we just put them in "bin", "etc", "lib", and "share" directories
# under Contents/Resources, rather than in the "bin", "etc", "lib",
# and "share" directories under the installation directory.

OPTIONS
	-h,--help
		Display this help message.
	-s
		Strip the libraries and executables from debugging symbols.
	-l,--libraries
		Specify the path to the libraries Wireshark depends on
