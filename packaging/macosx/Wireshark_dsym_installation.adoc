== Debugging Symbols for Wireshark

This archive contains the debugging symbols for Wireshark {wireshark-version}.
The debugging symbols are only necessary if Wireshark is crashing and you need to report an issue to the Wireshark development team.

WARNING: This won't work properly with any version other than Wireshark {wireshark-version}.

To install the symbols, drag _Wireshark.dSYM_ to the same location as _Wireshark_.
This is usually your _Applications_ folder.

To uninstall, drag _Wireshark.dSYM_ to the trash.
