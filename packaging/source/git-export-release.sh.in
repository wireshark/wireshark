# Creates a release tarball directly from git

# Note that the tarball contents might not exactly match
# a particular git commit, particularly for untagged
# commits.
#
# An alternative approach would be to generate source tarballs
# using CPack. That would remove our dependency on git, but if
# Autotools is any indication it would require continuous
# maintenance.
