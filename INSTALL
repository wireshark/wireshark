Installation
============

These are installation instructions for Unix and Unix-like systems
that can run the "configure" script in this same directory. These
are not the installation instructions for Windows systems; see
README.win32 for those instructions.

0. This is alpha software.  Beware.

1. If you wish to build Ethereal, make sure you have GTK+ and GLIB
    installed. Try running 'gtk-config --version' and
    'glib-config --version' to see if you have them installed.
    Ethereal needs versions 1.2.0 or above of both these packages.
    If you need to install or re-install GTK+ or GLIB, you can find
    the packages at:

        http://www.gtk.org

    If you installed GTK+ from a binary package, you may have to
    install a "development" package; there may be separate "user's"
    and "developer's" packages, with the former not including
    header files and the like.  For example, Red Hat users will
    need to install a "gtk-devel" .rpm.

2. If you wish to build Tethereal, the line-mode version of Ethereal,
    make sure you have GLIB installed.  See note #1 above for instructions
    on checking if you have GLIB installed. You can download GLIB from
    the same site as GTK.

3. If you want to capture packets, make sure you have libpcap
    installed.  The latest "official" version can be found at

    http://www.tcpdump.org .

    If you've downloaded the 0.5.2 version, make sure you install
    the headers ('make install-incl') when you install the library.
    The CVS snapshots will install the headers if you do 'make
    install', and have no 'install-incl' target.

    If you installed libpcap from a binary package, you may have to
    install a "development" package; for example, there's
    apparently a "libpcap0" Debian package, but it just includes a
    shared library, a copyright notice, changelog files, and a
    README file - you also need to install a "libpcap-dev" package
    to get header files, a non-shared library, and the man page.
    Similarly, Red Hat 5.x users will need to install a "libpcap-devel"
    .rpm to go along with the "libpcap" .rpm.

4. Run './configure' in the Ethereal distribution directory.
    Running './configure --help' displays a list of options.
    The file 'INSTALL.configure' contains general instructions for
    using 'configure' and 'make'. Ethereal has some
    non-generic configure options:

    --sysconfdir=DIR
        Ethereal installs a support file (manuf) in ${PREFIX}/etc by
        default, where ${PREFIX} comes from --prefix=DIR. If you do not
        specify any --prefix option, ${PREFIX} is "/usr/local".
        You can change the location of the manuf file with the --sysconfdir
        option.

    --disable-usr-local
        By default 'configure' will look in /usr/local/{include,lib} for
        additional header files and libraries. Using this switch keeps
        'configure' from looking there

    --disable-ethereal
        By default, if 'configure' finds the GTK+ libraries, the Makefile
        build Ethereal, the GUI packet analyzer. You can disable the
        build of the GUI version of Ethereal with this switch.

    --disable-tethereal
        By default the line-mode packet analyzer, Tethereal, is built.
        Use this switch to avoid building it.

    --disable-editcap
        By default the capture-file editing program is built.
        Use this switch to avoid building it.

    --disable-mergecap
        By default the capture-file merging program is built.
        Use this switch to avoid building it.

    --disable-text2pcap
        By default the hex-dump-to-capture file conversion program
        is built. Use this switch to avoid building it.

    --disable-idl2eth
        By default the IDL-to-ethereal-dissector-source-code converter
        is built. Use this switch to avoid building it.

    --enable-dftest
        By default the display-filter-compiler test program is not built.
        Use this switch to build it.

    --enable-randpkt
        By default the program which creates random packet-capture files
        is not built. Use this switch to build it.

    --without-pcap
        If you chose to build a packet analyzer that can analyze
        capture files but cannot capture packets on its own, but you
        *do* have libpcap installed, use --without-pcap to avoid
        using libpcap.

    --with-pcap=DIR
        Use this tell Ethereal where you have libpcap installed, if in a
        non-standard location.

    --disable-zlib
        By default, if 'configure' finds zlib (a.k.a, libz), the
        wiretap library will be built so that it can read compressed
        capture files. If you have zlib but do not wish to build
        it into the wiretap library, used by Ethereal, Tethereal, and
        the capture-file utilities that come in this package, use
        this switch.

    --disable-ipv6
        If 'configure' finds support for IPv6 name resolution on
        your system, the packet analyzers will make use of it.
        To avoid using IPv6 name resolution if you have the support for it,
        use this switch.

    --enable-setuid-install
        Use this switch to install the packet analyzers as setuid.
        Installating Ethereal and Tethereal as setuid 'root' is
        dangerous. Repeat: IT'S DANGEROUS. Don't do it.

    --with-ssl=DIR
        If your SNMP library needs the SSL library, and your
        SSL library is installed in a non-standard location,
        you can specify where your SSL library is with this switch.

    --disable-snmp
        If 'configure' finds a supported version of the UCD SNMP library
        on your system,  the SNMP dissector will be enhanced to use
        routines from that SNMP library.   Use this switch to avoid
        using the UCD SNMP library even if you have it installed.

    --with-ucdsnmp=DIR
        Tell the 'configure' script where your UCD SNMP library
        is located, if not in a standard location.

    --without-plugins
        By default, if your system can support run-time loadable modules,
        the packet analyzers are build with support for plugins.
        Use this switcht to build packet analyzers without plugin support.

    --with-plugins=DIR
        By default, plugins are installed in
        ${LIBDIR}/ethereal/plugins/${VERSION}

        ${LIBDIR} can be set with --libdir, or defaults to ${EPREFIX/lib}
        ${EPREFIX} can be set with --exec-prefix, or defaults to ${PREFIX}
        ${VERSION} is the Etherael version.

        Use this switch to change the location where plugins
        are installed.

5. After running './configure', you will see a summary of some
    of the options you chose. Ensure that the summary reflects
    what you want. If it doesn't, re-run './configure' with new options.

6. Run 'make'.  Hopefully, you won't run into any problems.

7. Run './ethereal' or './tethereal', and make sure things are working.
    You must have root privileges in order to capture live data.

8. Run 'make install'.  If you wish to install the man page, run
    'make install-man'.  If you're running a system that supports
    the Apt, RPM, or System V Release 4 packaging systems, you can
    run one of

    make debian-package	# Builds a binary package using dpkg
    make rpm-package	# Builds a binary package using rpm
    make srpm-package	# Builds a source package using rpm
    make svr4-package	# Builds a source package using pkgmk
    make solaris-package	# Same as "make svr4-package"

    to make an installable package for your system.

If you have trouble with the build or installation process, you can
find assistance on the ethereal-users and ethereal-dev mailing lists.
