Wireshark 3.3.2 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 3.4.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Many improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated Features”
  section below for more details.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.3.1:

     • Nothing of note.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.3.0:

     • The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.00. They previously
       shipped with Npcap 0.9997.

     • The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.15.1. They previously
       shipped with Qt 5.12.8.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.2.0:

     • Windows executables and installers are now signed using SHA-2
       only[1].

     • Save RTP stream to .au supports any codec with 8000 Hz rate
       supported by Wireshark (shown in RTP player). If save of audio is
       not possible (unsupported codec or rate), silence of same length
       is saved and warning is shown.

     • Asynchronous DNS resolution is always enabled. As a result, the
       c-ares library is now a required dependency.

     • Protobuf fields can be dissected as Wireshark (header) fields
       that allows user input the full names of Protobuf fields or
       messages in Filter toolbar for searching.

     • Dissectors based on Protobuf can register themselves to a new
       'protobuf_field' dissector table, which is keyed with the full
       names of fields, for further parsing fields of BYTES or STRING
       type.

     • Wireshark is able to decode, play, and save iLBC payload on
       platforms where the iLBC library[2] is available.

     • Wireshark is able to decode, play, and save opus payload on
       platforms where the opus library[3] is available.

     • “Decode As” entries can now be copied from other profiles using a
       button in the dialog.

     • sshdump can now be copied to multiple instances. Each instance
       will show up a different interface and will have its own profile.

     • The main window now supports a packet diagram view, which shows
       each packet as a textbook-style diagram.

     • Filter buttons (“Preferences → Filter Buttons”) can be grouped by
       using “//” as a path separator in the filter button label.
