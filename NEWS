Ethereal 0.10.13 has been released.

  Bug Fixes

   Several security vulnerabilities have been fixed since the previous
   release. See the [1]application advisory for more details.

     o The ISAKMP dissector could exhaust system memory. Versions affected:
       0.10.11 to 0.10.12.

     o The FC-FCS dissector could exhaust system memory. Versions affected:
       0.9.0 to 0.10.12.

     o The RSVP dissector could exhaust system memory. Versions affected:
       0.9.4 to 0.10.12.

     o The ISIS LSP dissector could exhaust system memory. Versions affected:
       0.8.18 to 0.10.12.

     o The IrDA dissector could crash. Versions affected: 0.10.0 to 0.10.12.

     o The SLIMP3 dissector could overflow a buffer. Versions affected: 0.9.1
       to 0.10.12.

     o The BER dissector was susceptible to an infinite loop. Versions
       affected: 0.10.3 to 0.10.12.

     o The SCSI dissector could dereference a null pointer and crash.
       Versions affected: 0.10.3 to 0.10.12.

     o If the "Dissect unknown RPC program numbers" option was enabled, the
       ONC RPC dissector might be able to exhaust system memory. This option
       is disabled by default. Versions affected: 0.7.7 to 0.10.12.

     o The sFlow dissector could dereference a null pointer and crash.
       Versions affected: 0.9.14 to 0.10.12.

     o The RTnet dissector could dereference a null pointer and crash.
       Versions affected: 0.10.8 to 0.10.12.

     o The SigComp UDVM could go into an infinite loop or crash. Versions
       affected: 0.10.12.

     o If SMB transaction payload reassembly is enabled the SMB dissector
       could crash. This preference is disabled by default. Versions
       affected: 0.9.7 to 0.10.12.

     o The X11 dissector could attempt to divide by zero. Versions affected:
       0.10.1 to 0.10.12.

     o The AgentX dissector could overflow a buffer. Versions affected:
       0.10.10 to 0.10.12.

     o The WSP dissector could free an invalid pointer. Versions affected:
       0.10.1 to 0.10.12.

     o iDEFENSE found a buffer overflow in the SRVLOC dissector. Versions
       affected: 0.10.0 to 0.10.12.

   When trying to save a flow graph, Ethereal could crash.

   When viewing protocol hierarchy statistics, Ethereal and Tethereal could
   crash.

   The PCRE library that ships with the Windows installer has been upgraded
   from version 4.4 to 6.3 in response to a [2]security vulnerability.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since
   the last release:

     o The timestamp display precision of the Packet List can be adjusted
       now. The precision will be automatically adjusted depending on the
       file format loaded, e.g. libpcap typically uses microsecond resolution
       displayed like "0.000000". In addition you can adjust the precision
       manually through the View/Time Display Format menu items.

     o The WinPcap version 3.1 installer was released since the last Ethereal
       release. The version included in the Ethereal Windows installer has
       been updated from 3.1 beta 4 to 3.1. If you want to upgrade WinPcap
       separately or install a different version you can download it from:
       [3]the WinPcap web site.

     o The behavior of the display filter "ip.checksum_bad" has changed.
       Instead of merely checking for its presence you must now make sure it
       is set, e.g. instead of using "ip.checksum_bad" you must now use
       "ip.checksum_bad == 1".

     o A new capture file format "Nanosecond libpcap (Ethereal)" was added.
       It is very similar to the common libpcap file format but is capable of
       keeping nanosecond resolution timestamps. This format is currently
       supported only by Ethereal.

     o Ethereal's memory managment has been greatly improved.

     o Ethereal can now save gzip-compressed capture files.

Getting Ethereal

  Microsoft Windows

   Download ethereal-setup-0.10.13.exe from the [4]Windows download area on
   the main web site. Double-click the installer executable.

  Sun Solaris

   Download the appropriate package from the [5]Solaris download area on the
   main web site. Uncompress the package using bzip2, and install it using
   pkgadd.

  Source Code

   Download ethereal-0.10.13.tar.gz from the [6]main download area on the web
   site. Extract the package using tar and gzip. Run "configure ; make ; make
   install".

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Ethereal packages. You can
   install or upgrade Ethereal using the package management system specific
   to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found on the
   [7]download page on the Ethereal web site.

File Locations

   Ethereal and Tethereal look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
   from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the default
   locations on your system.

Known Problems

   On Windows systems the packet list scroll bar can sometimes disappear or
   become unusable. Until the problem is fixed you can work around it by
   resizing the packet list or the main window. ([8]Bug #220)

Getting Help

   Community support is available on the ethereal-users mailing list.
   Subscription information and archives for all of Ethereal's mailing lists
   can be found on [9]the web site. There is also an [10]IRC channel
   dedicated to Ethereal.

   Commercial support, training, and development services are available from
   [11]Ethereal Software.

Frequently Asked Questions

   A complete FAQ is available on the [12]Ethereal web site.

Ethereal 0.9.8 has been released.

  Serious problems with the BGP, LMP, PPP, and TDS dissectors have
  been
  discovered.  See

    http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00007.html

  for more details.


New and Updated Features

  The TAP subsystem received major updates.  Tethereal can display
  more statistics, and several graphs have been added to Ethereal.

  A protocol hierarchy statistics tap was added to tethereal.  This
  code
  may be used to replace the hierarchy statistics code in Ethereal.

  More updates have been added to TCP analysis.

  After a long hiatus, the Windows installer once again includes SNMP
  support.

  The total running time of the capture is now displayed in the
  capture
  progress dialog box.  The capture progress dialog also shows ARP
  packets.

  The look of the plugins dialog was revamped.


Bug Fixes and Updates

  A bug which caused Ethereal under Windows to crash when "Update list
  of
  packets in real time" was enabled has been fixed.

  The stability of the text2pcap utility has been improved.

  In tethereal, the packet count is properly displayed when you ^C out
  of a
  capture.

== September 28, 2002

Ethereal 0.9.7 has been released.

New Features

  In order to improve the out-of-box responsiveness of Ethereal and
  Tethereal, network name resolution has been disabled by default.

  TCP analysis (a feature added in the 0.9.6 release) was improved.

  The NCP code base received quite a few updates.

  Initial support for version 2 of the GTK+ library was added.

  RPC staticstics (which use the new Tap API) were added.

  Due to added and updated support for the NTLM, SNEGO, and GSS-API
  protocols, Ethereal can now dissect most of the security blobs for
  Windows 2000 authentication.

  The Ethernet "manuf" file now handles addresses specified with a
  mask, and  contains many well-known addresses.


New Protocols

  802.1s MSTP, FIX, GSS-API, Interbase, NDPS, Netflow (Cisco and
  Juniper),
  SCCP-Management, SPNEGO

== August 20, 2002

Ethereal 0.9.6 has been released.

Bugs Fixed

  A buffer overflow in the ISIS dissector has been fixed.  More
  information can be found at
  http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00006.html.

  A bad TCP header could cause problems for the "Follow TCP Stream"
  feature.

  Setting "column.format" from the command line no longer crashes
  Ethereal and Tethereal.

  Problems with capture files being overwritten (e.g. if you try to
  save over
  the current capture file) have been fixed.

  An SMB conversation handling bug has been fixed.

  Thanks to Valgrind, several memory leaks have been fixed.

  Some problems with printing under Windows have been fixed.


New Features

  TCP sequence number analysis has been added.

  The DCE RPC NETLOGON dissector has received a major overhaul.

  Data types throughout the code have been cleaned up.
