   used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:
     * "On-the-wire" packet lengths are limited to 65535 bytes. ([1]Bug
       8808, ws-buglink:9390)
     * "Follow TCP Stream" shows only the first HTTP req+res. ([2]Bug
       9044)
     * Files with pcap-ng Simple Packet Blocks can't be read. ([3]Bug
       9200)
     * MPLS-over-PPP isn't recognized. ([4]Bug 9492)

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.11.2:
     * Qt port:
          + The About dialog has been added
          + The Capture Interfaces dialog has been added.
          + The Decode As dialog has been added.
          + Several SCTP dialogs have been added.
          + The statistics tree (the backend for many Statistics and
            Telephony menu items) dialog has been added.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.11.1:
     * Mac OS X packaging has been improved.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.11.0:
     * Dissector output may be encoded as UTF-8. This includes TShark
       output.
     * Qt port:
          + The Follow Stream dialog now supports packet and TCP stream
            selection.
          + A Flow Graph (sequence diagram) dialog has been added.
          + The main window now respects geometry preferences.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.10:
     * Wireshark now uses the Qt application framework. The new UI should
       provide a significantly better user experience, particularly on Mac
       OS X and Windows.
     * The Windows installer now uninstalls the previous version of
       Wireshark silently. You can still run the uninstaller manually
       beforehand if you wish to run it interactively.
     * Expert information is now filterable when the new API is in use.
     * The "Number" column shows related packets and protocol conversation
       spans (Qt only).
     * When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C <choplen>
       and/or -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible to also adjust the
       original frame length using the -L option.
     * You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap multiple times,
       which allows you to chop bytes from the beginning of a packet as
       well as at the end of a packet in a single step.
     * You can now specify an optional offset to the -C option for
       editcap, which allows you to start chopping from that offset
       instead of from the absolute packet beginning or end.
     * "malformed" display filter has been renamed to "_ws.malformed". A
       handful of other filters have been given the "_ws." prefix to note
       they are Wireshark application specific filters and not dissector
       filters.

  Removed dissectors

     * The ASN1 plugin has been removed as it's deemed obsolete.
     * The GNM dissector has been removed as it was never used.

  Major API Changes

   The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:
     * A more flexible, modular memory manger (wmem) has been added. It
       was available experimentally in 1.10 but is now mature and has
       mostly replaced the old emem API (which is deprecated).
     * A new API for expert information has been added, replacing the old
       one.
     * The tvbuff API has been cleaned up: tvb_length has been renamed to
       tvb_captured_length for clarity, and tvb_get_string has been
       deprecated in favour of tvb_get_string_enc.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [5]http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be
   found on the [6]download page on the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
