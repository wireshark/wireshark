Wireshark 3.5.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 3.6.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Many improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated Features”
  section below for more details.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.4.0:

     • The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.10. They previously
       shipped with Npcap 1.00.

     • TCP conversations now support a completeness criteria, which
       facilitates the identification of TCP streams having any of
       opening or closing handshakes, a payload, in any combination. It
       is accessed with the new tcp.completeness filter.

     • Protobuf fields that are not serialized on the wire (missing in
       capture files) can now be displayed with default values by
       setting the new 'add_default_value' preference. The default
       values might be explicitly declared in 'proto2' files, or false
       for bools, first value for enums, zero for numeric types.

     • Wireshark now supports reading Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). A
       new extcap named ETW reader is created that now can open an etl
       file, convert all events in the file to DLT_ETW packets and write
       to a specified FIFO destination. Also, a new packet_etw dissector
       is created to dissect DLT_ETW packets so Wireshark can display
       the DLT_ETW packet header, its message and packet_etw dissector
       calls packet_mbim sub_dissector if its provider matches the MBIM
       provider GUID.

  New Protocol Support

   Kerberos SPAKE, O-RAN fronthaul UC-plane (O-RAN), PDU Transport
   Protocol, and State Synchronization Protocol (SSyncP)
