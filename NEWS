  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.4.0:

     • Protobuf fields that are not serialized on the wire (missing in
       capture files) can now be displayed with default values by
       setting the new 'add_default_value' preference. The default
       values might be explicitly declared in 'proto2' files, or false

 Getting Wireshark

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[1] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use About → Folders
  to find the default locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/
