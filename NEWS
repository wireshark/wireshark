Wireshark 3.3.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 3.4.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Many improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated Features”
  section below for more details.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.2.0:

     • Windows executables and installers are now signed using SHA-2
       only[1].

     • Save RTP stream to .au supports any codec with 8000 Hz rate
       supported by Wireshark (shown in RTP player). If save of audio is
       not possible (unsupported codec or rate), silence of same length
       is saved and warning is shown.

     • C-ares is now a required dependency.

     • Protobuf fields can be dissected as wireshark (header) fields
       that allows user input the full names of Protobuf fields or
       messages in Filter toolbar for searching.

     • Dissector based on Protobuf can register itself to a new
       'protobuf_field' dissector table, which is keyed with the full
       names of fields, for further parsing fields of BYETS or STRING
       type.

     • Wireshark is able to decode, play and save iLBC payload on
       platforms where iLBC library
       (https://github.com/TimothyGu/libilbc) is available.

     • Decode As entries can now be copied from other profiles using a
       button in the dialog.

     • sshdump can now be copied in multiple instances. Each instance
       will show up a different interface and will have its own profile.

     • The main window now supports a packet diagram view, which shows
       each packet as a textbook-style diagram.
