       now fully mature.
     * The (long-since-broken) Python bindings support has been removed.
       If you want to write dissectors in something other than C, use Lua.
     * Plugins can now create GUI menu items.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [2]https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be
   found on the [3]download page on the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
