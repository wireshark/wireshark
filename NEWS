Wireshark 3.5.1 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 3.6.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Many improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated Features”
  section below for more details.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.4.0:

     • The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.50.

     • A 64-bit Windows PortableApps package is now available.

     • A macOS Arm 64 (Apple Silicon) package is now available.

     • TCP conversations now support a completeness criteria, which
       facilitates the identification of TCP streams having any of
       opening or closing handshakes, a payload, in any combination. It
       is accessed with the new tcp.completeness filter.

     • Protobuf fields that are not serialized on the wire (missing in
       capture files) can now be displayed with default values by
       setting the new 'add_default_value' preference. The default
       values might be explicitly declared in 'proto2' files, or false
       for bools, first value for enums, zero for numeric types.

     • Wireshark now supports reading Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). A
       new extcap named ETW reader is created that now can open an etl
       file, convert all events in the file to DLT_ETW packets and write
       to a specified FIFO destination. Also, a new packet_etw dissector
       is created to dissect DLT_ETW packets so Wireshark can display
       the DLT_ETW packet header, its message and packet_etw dissector
       calls packet_mbim sub_dissector if its provider matches the MBIM
       provider GUID.

     • "Follow DCCP stream" feature to filter for and extract the
       contents of DCCP streams.

     • Wireshark now supports dissecting the rtp packet with OPUS
       payload.

     • Importing captures from text files is now also possible based on
       regular expressions. By specifying a regex capturing a single
       packet including capturing groups for relevant fields a textfile
       can be converted to a libpcap capture file. Supported data
       encodings are plain-hexadecimal, -octal, -binary and base64. Also
       the timestamp format now allows the second-fractions to be placed
       anywhere in the timestamp and it will be stored with nanosecond
       instead of microsecond precision.

     • Display filter literal strings can now be specified using raw
       string syntax, identical to raw strings in the Python programming
       language. This is useful to avoid the complexity of using two
       levels of character escapes with regular expressions.

     • Significant RTP Player redesign and improvements (see Wireshark
       User Documentation, Playing VoIP Calls[1] and RTP Player
       Window[2])

     • RTP Player can play many streams in row

     • UI is more responsive

     • RTP Player maintains playlist, other tools can add/remove streams
       to it

     • Every stream can be muted or routed to L/R channel for replay

     • Save audio is moved from RTP Analysis to RTP Player. RTP Player
       saves what was played. RTP Player can save in multichannel .au or
       .wav.

     • RTP Player added to menu Telephony>RTP>RTP Player

   VoIP dialogs (VoIP Calls, RTP Streams, RTP Analysis, RTP Player, SIP
   Flows) are non-modal, can stay opened on background

     • Same tools are provided across all dialogs (Prepare Filter,
       Analyse, RTP Player …​)

   Follow stream is now able to follow SIP calls based on their Call-ID
   value.

   Follow stream YAML output format’s has been changed to add timestamps
   and peers information (for more details see the user’s guide,
   Following Protocol Streams[3])

   IP fragments between public IPv4 addresses are now reassembled even
   if they have different VLAN IDs. Reassembly of IP fragments where one
   endpoint is a private (RFC 1918 section 3) or link-local (RFC 3927)
   IPv4 address continues to take the VLAN ID into account, as those
   addresses can be reused. To revert to the previous behavior and not
   reassemble fragments with different VLAN IDs, turn on the "Enable
   stricter conversation tracking heuristics" top level protocol
   preference.

   USB Link Layer reassembly has been added, which allows hardware
   captures to be analyzed at the same level as software captures.

   TShark can now export TLS session keys with the
   --export-tls-session-keys option.

   Wireshark participated in the Google Season of Docs 2020 and the
   User’s Guide has been extensively updated.

   Format of export to CSV in RTP Stream Analysis dialog was slightly
   changed. First line of export contains names of columns as in other
   CSV exports.

   Wireshark now supports the Turkish language.

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
  https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[4] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use About → Folders
  to find the default locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[5] and on the
  wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information and archives
  for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found on the web site[6].

  Bugs and feature requests can be reported on the issue tracker[7].

 Frequently Asked Questions
