What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following vulnerabilities have been fixed. See the security
   advisory for details and a workaround.

     o Wireshark is vulnerable to DLL hijacking as described in
       Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637. This problem is fully
       fixed on Windows XP SP1 and later. It is partially fixed on
       Windows 2000 and XP without services packs. We expect to
       address those platforms in future releases. If you are running
       Wireshark on Windows 2000 or XP we recommend that you only
       open capture files within Wireshark. (Bug 5133)

       Versions affected: All previous Windows versions up to and
       including 1.0.15 and 1.2.10.
