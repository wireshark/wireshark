Wireshark 3.1.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 3.2.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Many improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated Features”
  section below for more details.

  Windows .msi packages are now signed using SHA-2[1]. .exe installers
  are still dual-signed using SHA-1 and SHA-2.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.0.0:

     • Drag&Drop a field to a column header to create a column for that
       field, or to the display filter input to create a display filter.
       If a display filter is applied, the new filter can be added using
       the same rules as "Apply Filter"

     • Drag&Drop a column entry to the display filter to create a filter
       for it

     • Import profiles from a .zip archive or an existing directory

     • Dark mode support on macOS and dark theme support on other
       platforms has been improved.

     • Brotli decompression support in HTTP/HTTP2 (requires the brotli
       library).

     • The build system now checks for a SpeexDSP system library
       installation. The bundled Speex resampler code is still provided
       as a fallback.

     • WireGuard decryption can now be enabled through keys embedded in
       a pcapng in addition to the existing key log preference (Bug
       15571[2]).

     • A new tap for extracting credentials from the capture file has
       been added. It can be accessed through the "-z credentials"
       option in tshark or from the "tools" menu in Wireshark.

     • Editcap can now split files on floating point intervals.

  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to
  find the default locations on your system.
