# Files listed here are ignored by the git pre-commit hook for the purpose
# of checking for forbidden APIs and other dissector-specific glitches.

# Each line is compared against the output of 'git diff-index --name-only'.
# For example to skip checking this file add:
#
# tools/pre-commit-ignore.conf
#
# The pathname wildcards allowed are: '*', '?', character set '[abc]' or
# negated with '[!abc]'.
