- warn when union instances don't have a discriminant

- true multiple dimension array / strings in arrays support

- compatibility mode for generating MIDL-readable data:
 - strip out pidl-specific properties

- make bitmap an optional attribute on enum
- support nested elements
- support typedefs properly (e.g. allow "typedef void **bla;")
- make typedefs generate real typedefs
- improve represent_as(): allow it to be used for arrays and other complex 
  types

- --explain-ndr option that dumps out parse tree ?

- separate tables for NDR and DCE/RPC
 - maybe no tables for NDR at all? we only need them for ndrdump 
   and that can use dlsym()

- allow data structures outside of interfaces

- mem_ctx in the interface rather than as struct ndr member.

- real typelibs

- fix [in,out] handling and allocation for samba3:
 - add inout
 - make NULL to mean "allocate me"
 - remove NDR_AUTO_REF_ALLOC flag

- automatic test generator based on IDL pointer types

- support converting structs to tuples in Python rather than objects
- convert structs with a single mattering member to that member directly, e.g.:
  struct bar {
    int size;
	[size_is(size)] uint32 *array;
  };

  should be converted to an array of uint32's

- python: fill in size members automatically in some places if the struct isn't being returned
  (so we don't have to cope with the array growing)
