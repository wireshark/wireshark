WARNING: these tests are in alpha state!

What is it?
-----------
This is basically a collection of bash scripts to test the command line options of:

 - Wireshark
 - TShark
 - Dumpcap 

Motivation
----------

The command line options of Wireshark and the companion command line tools are 
numerous. This makes it hard to find newly introduced bugs doing manual testing 
(try and error) with source code changes.

The current way is to do some changes, testing some scenarios by hand and 
commit the code so other users will complain about new problems. This obviously 
is far from being optimal.

Limitations
-----------

The test set currently provided will only do some basic tests, but even that 
is far better than nothing. This may involve in time as new tests can be added
to fix problems reported by users. This will hopefully lead to a "complete" 
and reliable testset in the future.

The tests are limited to command line tests, other things like unit tests or 
GUI test are not included.

Prerequisites
-------------

What you'll need (to do):

 - THE LATEST DEVELOPER BUILDS (the 0.10.13 release won't work)!
 - obviously, compile the programs (wireshark, ...) to be tested
 - have a bash (cygwin should do well)
 - you'll need a network interface with some network traffic 
   (so you can run the capture tests)
 - edit the file config.sh to suit your configuration

A Test Ride
-----------

Start test.sh which should provide a basic menu. Just press Enter to start 
all tests.

It should start all the available tests. Each test will throw out a line 
which should end with a green "Ok". If one of the tests fail, the script
will report it and stop at this test step.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO HAVE SOME TRAFFIC ON YOUR NETWORK INTERFACE!!!
