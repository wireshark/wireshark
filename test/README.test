What is it?
-----------
This is a collection of bash scripts which test the features of:

 - Wireshark
 - TShark
 - Dumpcap 

Motivation
----------

The command line options of Wireshark and the companion command line tools are 
numerous. This makes it hard to find newly introduced bugs doing manual testing 
(try and error) with source code changes.

The current way is to do some changes, testing some scenarios by hand and 
commit the code so other users will complain about new problems. This obviously 
is far from being optimal.

Limitations
-----------

The test set currently provided will only do some basic tests, but even that 
is far better than nothing. This may involve in time as new tests can be added
to fix problems reported by users. This will hopefully lead to a "complete" 
and reliable testset in the future.

The tests are limited to command line tests, other things like unit tests or 
GUI test are not included.

Prerequisites
-------------

What you'll need (to do):

 - edit the file config.sh to suit your configuration
 - obviously, compile the programs (wireshark, ...) to be tested
 - have a bash (cygwin should do well)
 - have tput (e.g. in the cygwin ncurses package)
 - you'll need a network interface with some network traffic 
   (so you can run the capture tests)
 - (for non-Windows platforms) An X server for running the capture tests with
   the graphical Wireshark program.

A Test Ride
-----------

The default configuration might not be suitable for your set-up. Most settings
can be adjusted by setting an environment variable matching or by editing the
setting in config.sh.

For instance, the first network interface might not be used for traffic (like an
unconnected Ethernet port). In that case, you might want to set the environment
variable TRAFFIC_CAPTURE_IFACE to pick another interface. Use `dumpcap -D` to
get a list of devices.

On Windows, it is assumed that the user is able to perform captures. On
non-Windows platforms, the opposite is assumed. If your dumpcap executable
allows you to perform captures (for example, when it has appropriate
capabilities), then you can override the default with:

    SKIP_CAPTURE=0

If you do not want to test the binaries in the build directory, you can override
it with:

    WS_BIN_PATH=/usr/bin

When your configuration is sane, you can start test.sh which should provide a
basic menu. Just press Enter to start all tests.

It should start all the available tests. Each test will throw out a line 
which should end with a green "Ok". If one of the tests fail, the script
will report it and stop at this test step.

Please remember to have some ICMP traffic on your network interface! The test
suite will ping to www.wireshark.org while running capture tests, but this will
slow down the tests.
