// WSUG User Interface Chapter

[#ChapterUsing]

== User Interface

[#ChUseIntroductionSection]

=== Introduction

By now you have installed Wireshark and are likely keen to get started
capturing your first packets. In the next chapters we will explore:

* How the Wireshark user interface works
* How to capture packets in Wireshark
* How to view packets in Wireshark
* How to filter packets in Wireshark
* ... and many other things!

[#ChUseStartSection]

=== Start Wireshark

You can start Wireshark from your shell or window manager.

[TIP]
.Power user tip
====
When starting Wireshark it’s possible to specify optional settings using the
command line. See <<ChCustCommandLine>> for details.
====

The following chapters contain many screenshots of Wireshark. As
Wireshark runs on many different platforms with many different window managers,
different styles applied and there are different versions of the underlying GUI
toolkit used, your screen might look different from the provided screenshots.
But as there are no real differences in functionality these screenshots should
still be well understandable.

[#ChUseMainWindowSection]

=== The Main window

Let’s look at Wireshark’s user interface. <<ChUseFig01>> shows Wireshark as you
would usually see it after some packets are captured or loaded (how to do this
will be described later).

[#ChUseFig01]
.The Main window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-main.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Wireshark’s main window consists of parts that are commonly known from many
other GUI programs.

. The _menu_ (see <<ChUseMenuSection>>) is used to start actions.
. The _main toolbar_ (see <<ChUseMainToolbarSection>>) provides quick access to
  frequently used items from the menu.
. The _filter toolbar_ (see <<ChUseFilterToolbarSection>>) allows users to
  set _display filters_ to filter which packets are displayed (see
  <<ChWorkDisplayFilterSection>>).
. The _packet list pane_ (see <<ChUsePacketListPaneSection>>) displays a summary
  of each packet captured. By clicking on packets in this pane you control what is
  displayed in the other two panes.
. The _packet details pane_ (see <<ChUsePacketDetailsPaneSection>>) displays the
  packet selected in the packet list pane in more detail.
. The _packet bytes pane_ (see <<ChUsePacketBytesPaneSection>>) displays the
  data from the packet selected in the packet list pane, and highlights the field
  selected in the packet details pane.
. The _packet diagram pane_ (see <<ChUsePacketDiagramPaneSection>>) displays the
  packet selected in the packet list as a textbook-style diagram.
. The _statusbar_ (see <<ChUseStatusbarSection>>) shows some detailed
  information about the current program state and the captured data.

[TIP]
====
The layout of the main window can be customized by changing preference settings.
See <<ChCustPreferencesSection>> for details.
====

[#ChUseMainWindowNavSection]

==== Main Window Navigation

Packet list and detail navigation can be done entirely from the keyboard.
<<ChUseTabNav>> shows a list of keystrokes that will let you quickly move around
a capture file. See <<ChUseTabGo>> for additional navigation keystrokes.

[#ChUsePacketListPaneSection]

=== The “Packet List” Pane

The packet list pane displays all the packets in the current capture file.

[#ChUseWiresharkListPane]
.The “Packet List” pane
image::wsug_graphics/ws-list-pane.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Each line in the packet list corresponds to one packet in the capture file. If
you select a line in this pane, more details will be displayed in the “Packet
Details” and “Packet Bytes” panes.

While dissecting a packet, Wireshark will place information from the protocol
dissectors into the columns. As higher-level protocols might overwrite
information from lower levels, you will typically see the information from the
highest possible level only.

For example, let’s look at a packet containing TCP inside IP inside an Ethernet
packet. The Ethernet dissector will write its data (such as the Ethernet
addresses), the IP dissector will overwrite this by its own (such as the IP
addresses), the TCP dissector will overwrite the IP information, and so on.

There are many different columns available. You can choose which columns are
displayed in the preferences. See <<ChCustPreferencesSection>>.

The default columns will show:

* btn:[No.] The number of the packet in the capture file. This number won’t
  change, even if a display filter is used.

* btn:[Time] The timestamp of the packet. The presentation format of this
  timestamp can be changed, see <<ChWorkTimeFormatsSection>>.

* btn:[Source] The address where this packet is coming from.

* btn:[Destination] The address where this packet is going to.

* btn:[Protocol] The protocol name in a short (perhaps abbreviated) version.

* btn:[Length] The length of each packet.

* btn:[Info] Additional information about the packet content.

The first column shows how each packet is related to the selected packet. For
example, in the image above the first packet is selected, which is a DNS
request. Wireshark shows a rightward arrow for the request itself, followed by a
leftward arrow for the response in packet 2. Why is there a dashed line? There
are more DNS packets further down that use the same port numbers. Wireshark
treats them as belonging to the same conversation and draws a line connecting
them.

// Images were created on macOS 10.11 using a retina display. Lines were
// 36 physical pixels high.

[horizontal]
.Related packet symbols

image:wsug_graphics/related-first.png[{related-attrs}]::

  The selected packet is a duplicate acknowledgement of this packet.

image:wsug_graphics/related-segment.png[{related-attrs}]::
  The selected packet is related to this packet in some other way, e.g., as part
  of reassembly.

The packet list has an _Intelligent Scrollbar_ which shows a miniature map of
nearby packets. Each https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics[raster line]
of the scrollbar corresponds to a single packet, so the number of packets shown
in the map depends on your physical display and the height of the packet list. A
tall packet list on a high-resolution (“Retina”) display will show you quite a
few packets. In the image above the scrollbar shows the status of more than 500
packets along with the 15 shown in the packet list itself.

Right clicking will show a context menu, described in
<<ChWorkPacketListPanePopUpMenu>>.

[#ChUsePacketDetailsPaneSection]

=== The “Packet Details” Pane

The packet details pane shows the current packet (selected in the “Packet List”
pane) in a more detailed form.

[#ChUseWiresharkDetailsPane]

.The “Packet Details” pane
image::wsug_graphics/ws-details-pane.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

This pane shows the protocols and protocol fields of the packet selected in the
“Packet List” pane. The protocol summary lines (subtree labels) and fields of the
packet are shown in a tree which can be expanded and collapsed.

There is a context menu (right mouse click) available. See details in
<<ChWorkPacketDetailsPanePopUpMenu>>.

Some protocol fields have special meanings.

* *Generated fields.* Wireshark itself will generate additional protocol
  information which isn’t present in the captured data. This information
  is enclosed in square brackets (“[” and “]”). Generated information
  includes response times, TCP analysis, IP geolocation information, and
  checksum validation.

* *Links.* If Wireshark detects a relationship to another packet in the capture
  file it will generate a link to that packet. Links are underlined and
  displayed in blue. If you double-clicked on a link  Wireshark will jump to the
  corresponding packet.

[#ChUsePacketBytesPaneSection]

=== The “Packet Bytes” Pane

The packet bytes pane shows the data of the current packet (selected in the
“Packet List” pane) in a hexdump style.

[#ChUseWiresharkBytesPane]

.The “Packet Bytes” pane
image::wsug_graphics/ws-bytes-pane.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

The “Packet Bytes” pane shows a canonical
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump[hex dump] of the packet data. Each line
contains the data offset, sixteen hexadecimal bytes, and sixteen ASCII bytes.
Non-printable bytes are replaced with a period (“.”).

Depending on the packet data, sometimes more than one page is available, e.g.
when Wireshark has reassembled some packets into a single chunk of data. (See
<<ChAdvReassemblySection>> for details). In this case you can see each data
source by clicking its corresponding tab at the bottom of the pane.

The default mode for viewing will highlight the bytes for a field where the 
mouse pointer is hovering above. The highlight will follow the mouse cursor
as it moves. If this highlighting is not required or wanted, there are two
methods for deactivating the functionality:

* *Temporary* By holding down the Ctrl button while moving the mouse, the
  highlighted field will not change

* *Permanently* Using the context menu (right mouse click) the hover highlighting
  may be activated/deactivated. This setting is stored in the selected profile
  __recent__ file.

The packet diagram pane shows the current packet (selected in the “Packet List”
pane) as a diagram, similar to ones used in textbooks and IETF RFCs.

[#ChUseWiresharkDiagramPane]

.The “Packet Diagram” pane
image::wsug_graphics/ws-diagram-pane.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

The statusbar displays informational messages.

In general, the left side will show context related information, the middle part
will show information about the current capture file, and the right side will
show the selected configuration profile. Drag the handles between the text areas
to change the size.
