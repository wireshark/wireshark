  <section id="ChAppFilesCaptureFilesSection"><title>Capture Files</title>
    <para>
	To understand which information will remain available after 
	the captured packets are saved to a capture file,
	it's helpful to know a bit about the capture file contents.
    </para>
    <para>
	Wireshark uses the libpcap file format as the default format to save 
	captured packets, this format exists for a long time and it's pretty simple.
	However, it has some drawbacks: it's not extensible and lacks some 
	information that would be really helpful (e.g. being able to add a comment
	to a packet "the problems start here" would be really nice).
    </para>
    <para>
	In addition to the libpcap format, Wireshark supports several different 
	capture file formats. However, the problems described above also applies 
	for these formats too.
    </para>
    <para>
	A new capture file format "PCAP Next Generation Dump File Format"
	is currently under development, which will fix these drawbacks. 
	However, it still might take a while until the new file format is ready 
	and Wireshark can use it.
    </para>
  <section id="ChIOFileContentSection"><title>Libpcap File Contents</title>
    <para>
	At the start of each libpcap capture file some basic information is stored 
	like a magic number to identify the libpcap file format. 
	The most interesting information of this file start is the link layer type 
	(Ethernet, Token Ring, ...). 
    </para>
    <para>
	The following data is saved for each packet:
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    the timestamp with millisecond resolution
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    the packet length as it was "on the wire"
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	  	the packet length as it's saved in the file
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    the packet's raw bytes
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
	A detailed description of the libpcap file format can be found at:

    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="ChIOFileNotContentSection"><title>Not Saved in the Capture File</title>
    <para>
	Probably even more interesting for the everyday Wireshark usage is to know
	the things that are <command>not saved</command> in the capture file:
	<itemizedlist>

	  <para>
	    current selections (selected packet, ...)
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>

	    name resolution information, see <xref 
		linkend="ChAdvNameResolutionSection"/> for details
		<warning><title>Warning!</title>
		<para>
		The name resolution information is rebuild each time Wireshark is 
		restarted so this information even might change when the capture file 
		is reopened on the same machine later!

    <section id="ChAppFilesConfigurationSection"><title>Configuration Files and Folders</title>
    <para>
      Wireshark uses a number of files and folders while it is running. Some 
	  of these reside in the personal configuration folder and are used to 
	  maintain information between runs of Wireshark, while some of them are 
	  maintained in system areas.
    </para>
	<tip><title>Tip</title>
	<para>A list of the folders Wireshark actually uses can be found under the 
	<command>Folders</command> tab in the dialog box coming up, when you select 
	<command>About Wireshark</command> from the <command>Help</command> menu.
	</para>
	</tip>
    <para>
	The content format of the configuration files is the same on all platforms.
	However, to match the different policies for unix and windows platforms, 
	different folders for these files are used.

	The following will only be applicable if you are using roaming profiles.
	This might be the case, if you work in a Windows domain environment

	There is an exception to this: The "Local Settings" folder in your profile 
	data (typically something like:
