  <section id="ChAppFilesCaptureFilesSection"><title>Capture Files</title>
    <para>
    To understand which information will remain available after
    the captured packets are saved to a capture file,
    it's helpful to know a bit about the capture file contents.
    </para>
    <para>
    Wireshark uses the libpcap file format as the default format to save
    captured packets; this format has existed for a long time and it's pretty simple.
    However, it has some drawbacks: it's not extensible and lacks some
    information that would be really helpful (e.g. being able to add a comment
    to a packet such as "the problems start here" would be really nice).
    </para>
    <para>
    In addition to the libpcap format, Wireshark supports several different
    capture file formats. However, the problems described above also applies
    for these formats.
    </para>
    <para>
    A new capture file format "PCAP Next Generation Dump File Format"
    is currently under development, which will fix these drawbacks.
    However, it still might take a while until the new file format is ready
    and Wireshark can use it.
    </para>
  <section id="ChIOFileContentSection"><title>Libpcap File Contents</title>
    <para>
    At the start of each libpcap capture file some basic information is stored
    like a magic number to identify the libpcap file format.
    The most interesting information of this file start is the link layer type
    (Ethernet, Token Ring, ...).
    </para>
    <para>
    The following data is saved for each packet:
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        the timestamp with millisecond resolution
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        the packet length as it was "on the wire"
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
          the packet length as it's saved in the file
      </para>

    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="ChIOFileNotContentSection"><title>Not Saved in the Capture File</title>
    <para>
    Probably even more interesting for everyday Wireshark usage is to know
    the things that are <command>not saved</command> in the capture file:
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        current selections (selected packet, ...)
      </para>
    </listitem>

        name resolution information, see <xref
        linkend="ChAdvNameResolutionSection"/> for details
        <warning><title>Warning!</title>
        <para>
        The name resolution information is rebuilt each time Wireshark is
        restarted so this information might even change when the capture file
        is reopened on the same machine later!

    <section id="ChAppFilesConfigurationSection"><title>Configuration Files and Folders</title>
    <para>
      Wireshark uses a number of files and folders while it is running. Some
      of these reside in the personal configuration folder and are used to
      maintain information between runs of Wireshark, while some of them are
      maintained in system areas.
    </para>
    <tip><title>Tip</title>
    <para>A list of the folders Wireshark actually uses can be found under the
    <command>Folders</command> tab in the dialog box shown when you select
    <command>About Wireshark</command> from the <command>Help</command> menu.
    </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
    The content format of the configuration files is the same on all platforms.
    However, to match the different policies for Unix and Windows platforms,
    different folders are used for these files.

    <section id="ChProtocolHelp"><title>Protocol help configuration</title>
    <para>
      Wireshark can use configuration files to create context-sensitive menu
      items for protocol detail items which will load help URLs in your web
      browser.
    </para>
    <para>
      To create a protocol help file, create a folder named "protocol_help"
      in either the personal or global configuration folders. Then create a
      text file with the extension ".ini" in the "protocol_help" folder. The
      file must contain key-value pairs with the following sections:
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>[database]</term>
          <listitem>
        <para>
          Mandatory. This contains initialization information for the
          help file. The following keys must be defined:
          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>source</term>
              <listitem><para>Source name, e.g. "HyperGlobalMegaMart".</para></listitem>

          <term>[location data]</term>
          <listitem>
        <para>
          Optional. Contains keys that will be used for variable
          substitution in the "location" value. For example, if
          the database section contains
          <programlisting>
location = http://www.example.com/proto?cookie=${cookie}&amp;path=${PATH}
          </programlisting>
          then setting
          <programlisting>
cookie = anonymous-user-1138
          </programlisting>
          will result in the URL
          "http://www.example.com/proto?cookie=anonymous-user-1138&amp;path=${PATH}".
          PATH is used for help path substitution, and shouldn't be defined in this section.

          <listitem>
        <para>
          Maps Wireshark protocol names to section names below. Each key
          MUST match a valid protocol name such as "ip". Each value MUST
          have a matching section defined in the configuration file.
        </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

      </variablelist>

      Each protocol section must contain an "_OVERVIEW" key which will be used
      as the first menu item for the help source. Subsequent keys must match
      descriptions in the protocol detail. Values will be used as the ${PATH}
      variable in the location template. If ${PATH} isn't present in the location
      template the value will be appended to the location.
    </para>

    <para>
      Suppose the file
      <filename>C:\Users\sam.clemens\AppData\Roaming\Wireshark\protocol_help\wikipedia.ini</filename>
      contains the following:

      <programlisting>
# Wikipedia (en) protocol help file.

# Help file initialization
# source: The source of the help information, e.g. "Inacon" or "Wikipedia"
# version: Currently unused. Must be "1".
# url_template: Template for generated URLs. See "URL Data" below.
[database]
source=Wikipedia
version=1
url_template=http://${language}.wikipedia.org/wiki/${PATH}

# Substitution data for the location template.
# Each occurrence of the keys below in the location template will be
# substituted with their corresponding values. For example, "${license}"
# in the URL template above will be replaced with the value of "license"
# below.
#
# PATH is reserved for the help paths below; do not specify it here.
[location data]
language = en

# Maps Wireshark protocol names to section names below. Each key MUST match
# a valid protocol name. Each value MUST have a matching section below.
[map]
tcp=TCP

# Mapped protocol sections.
# Keys must match protocol detail items descriptions.
[TCP]
_OVERVIEW=Transmission_Control_Protocol
Destination port=Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_ports
Source port=Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_ports
      </programlisting>
      Right-clicking on a TCP protocol detail item will display a help menu
      item that displays the Wikipedia page for TCP. Right-clicking on the
      TCP destination or source ports will display additional help menu items that
      take you to the "TCP ports" section of the page.
    </para>

    <para>
      The [location data] and ${PATH} can be omitted if they are not needed.
      For example, the following configuration is functionally equivalent to
      the previous configuration:
      <programlisting>
[database]
source=Wikipedia
version=1
location=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

[map]
tcp=TCP

    Windows uses some special directories to store user configuration files
        which define the "user profile". This can be confusing, as the default directory location
    changed from Windows version to version and might also be different for English
    and internationalized versions of Windows.

    If you've upgraded to a new Windows version, your profile might

    The following will only be applicable if you are using roaming profiles.
    This might be the case, if you work in a Windows domain environment
    (used in company networks). The configurations of all
    programs you use won't be saved on the local hard drive of the computer
    you are currently working on, but on the domain server.

    There is an exception to this: The "Local Settings" folder in your profile
    data (typically something like:
