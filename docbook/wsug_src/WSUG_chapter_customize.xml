	Wireshark's default behaviour will usually suit your needs pretty well.
	However, as you become more familiar with Wireshark, it can be customized
	in various ways to suit your needs even better. In this chapter we explore:

  <section id="ChCustCommandLine"><title>Start Wireshark from the command line</title>
    <para>
      You can start <application>Wireshark</application> from the command
      line, but it can also be started from most Window managers
      as well. In this section we will look at starting it from the command
      line.
    </para>
    <para>
      <application>Wireshark</application> supports a large number of
      command line parameters. To see what they are, simply enter the
      command <command>wireshark -h</command> and the help information
      shown in <xref linkend="ChCustEx1"/> (or something similar) should be
	  printed.

	We will examine each of the command line options in turn.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first thing to notice is that issuing the command
      <command>wireshark</command> by itself will bring up
      <application>Wireshark</application>.
      However, you can include as many of the command line parameters as
      you like. Their meanings are as follows ( in alphabetical order ):
	  XXX - is the alphabetical order a good choice? Maybe better task based?
      <variablelist>
	  <varlistentry><term><command>-a &lt;capture autostop condition></command></term>
	  <listitem>
		<para>
    	Specify a criterion that specifies when Wireshark is to stop writing
		to a capture file. The criterion is of the form test:value, where test
		is one of:
		<variablelist>
		<varlistentry><term><command>duration</command>:value</term>
			<listitem><para>

			<listitem><para>
			Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of value
			kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, not 1024 bytes). If
			this option is used together with the -b option, Wireshark will
			stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next
			one if filesize is reached.
			</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry><term><command>files</command>:value</term>

	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-b &lt;capture ring buffer option></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
		If a maximum capture file size was specified, this option causes Wireshark to run
		in "ring buffer" mode, with the specified number of files. In "ring
		buffer" mode, Wireshark will write to several capture files. Their
		name is based on the number of the file and on the creation date and
		time.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		When the first capture file fills up, Wireshark will switch to writing
		to the next file, until it fills up the last file, at which point
		it'll discard the data in the first file (unless 0 is specified, in
		which case, the number of files is unlimited) and start writing to
		that file and so on.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		If the optional duration is specified, Wireshark will also switch to
		the next file when the specified number of seconds has elapsed even
		if the current file is not completely fills up.

	<varlistentry><term><command>-B &lt;capture buffer size (Win32 only)></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Win32 only: set capture buffer size (in MB, default is 1MB). This
		  is used by the capture driver to buffer packet data until that
		  data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet drops while
		  capturing, try to increase this size.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-c &lt;capture packet count></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This option specifies the maximum number of packets to capture
	      when capturing live data.  It would be used in conjunction
	      with the <command>-k</command> option.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-D</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Print a list of the interfaces on which Wireshark can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the <command>-i</command> flag to specify an interface on which to capture.
	    </para>
	    <para>
This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking <command>ifconfig -a</command>);
the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems, where the
interface name is a somewhat complex string.
	    </para>
	    <para>
Note that "can capture" means that Wireshark was able to open
that device to do a live capture; if, on your system, a program doing a
network capture must be run from an account with special privileges (for
example, as root), then, if Wireshark is run with the <command>-D</command> flag and
is not run from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-f &lt;capture filter></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This option sets the initial capture filter expression to
	      be used when capturing packets.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-g &lt;packet number></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      After reading in a capture file using the -r flag, go to the given
		  packet number.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-h</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The <command>-h</command> option requests Wireshark to print
	      its version and usage instructions (as shown above) and exit.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-i &lt;capture interface></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.
	    </para>
	    <para>
Network interface names should match one of the names listed in
<command>wireshark -D</command> (described above); a number, as reported by
<command>wireshark -D</command>, can also be used.  If you're using UNIX, <command>netstat
-i</command> or <command>ifconfig -a</command> might also work to list interface names,
although not all versions of UNIX support the <command>-a</command> flag to <command>ifconfig</command>.
	    </para>
	    <para>
If no interface is specified, Wireshark searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces; if there are no interfaces,
Wireshark reports an error and doesn't start the capture.
	    </para>
	    <para>
Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or ``-'' to
read data from the standard input.  Data read from pipes must be in
standard libpcap format.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-J &lt;jump filter></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      After reading in a capture file using the <command>-r</command>
	      flag, jump to the first packet which matches the filter expression.
	      The filter expression is in display filter format. If an exact match
	      cannot be found the first packet afterwards is selected.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-j</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Use this option after the <command>-J</command> option to search
	      backwards for a first packet to go to.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-k</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The <command>-k</command> option specifies that Wireshark
	      should start capturing packets immediately.  This option
	      requires the use of the <command>-i</command> parameter to
	      specify the interface that packet capture will occur from.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-l</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This option turns on automatic scrolling if the packet
	      list pane is being updated automatically as packets arrive
	      during a capture ( as specified by the <command>-S</command>
	      flag).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-L</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>

	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-m &lt;font></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This option sets the name of the font used for most text

	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term><command>-N &lt;name resolving flags></command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Turns on name resolving for particular types of addresses
	      and port numbers; the argument is a string that may contain
	      the letters <command>m</command> to enable MAC address
	      resolution, <command>n</command> to enable network address
	      resolution, and <command>t</command> to enable transport-layer
	      port number resolution.  This overrides <command>-n</command>
	      if both <command>-N</command> and <command>-n</command> are
	      present. The letter C enables concurrent (asynchronous) DNS lookups.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><command>-o &lt;preference/recent settings&gt;</command></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Sets a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and
	      any value read from a preference/recent file.  The argument to the
	      flag is a string of the form prefname:value, where prefname
	      is the name of the preference (which is the same name that
	      would appear in the preference/recent file), and value is the value
	      to which it should be set.  Multiple instances of
	      <command>-o &lt;preference settings&gt; </command> can be
	      given on a single command line.
	    </para>
	    <para>An example of setting a single preference would be: </para>

		You can get a list of all available preference strings from the
		preferences file, see <xref linkend="AppFiles"/>.
	      </para>
	    </tip>
	    <para>User access tables can be overridden using "uat," followed by

	      </command>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The example above would dissect packets with a libpcap data
	      link type 147 as HTTP, just as if you had configured it in the
	      DLT_USER protocol preferences.

	      Don't put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that
	      the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other
	      reason; hence, -p cannot be used to ensure that the only
	      traffic that is captured is traffic sent to or from the

  <section id="ChCustColorizationSection"><title>Packet colorization</title>
    <para>
      A very useful mechanism available in Wireshark is packet colorization.
      You can set-up Wireshark so that it will colorize packets according to a
      filter. This allows you to emphasize the packets you are (usually)
      interested in.
    </para>
    <tip>
      <title>Tip!</title>
      <para>
	  You will find a lot of Coloring Rule examples at the <command>Wireshark
	  Wiki Coloring Rules page</command> at <ulink
	  url="&WiresharkWikiColoringRulesPage;">&WiresharkWikiColoringRulesPage;</ulink>.
      </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
      There are two types of coloring rules in Wireshark; temporary ones that are
      only used until you quit the program, and permanent ones that will be saved to
      a preference file so that they are available on a next session.
    </para>
    <para>
      Temporary coloring rules can be added by selecting a packet and pressing
      the &lt;ctrl&gt; key together with one of the number keys. This will
      create a coloring rule based on the currently selected conversation. It will
      try to create a conversation filter based on TCP first, then UDP, then IP
      and at last Ethernet. Temporary filters can also be created by selecting
      the "Colorize with Filter > Color X" menu items when rightclicking in the
      packet-detail pane.
    </para>

    <para>
      To permanently colorize packets, select the <command>Coloring Rules...</command> menu item from
      the <command>View</command> menu; Wireshark will pop up the "Coloring Rules"
      dialog box as shown in <xref linkend="ChCustColoringRulesDialog"/>.
    </para>
    <figure id="ChCustColoringRulesDialog">
      <title>The "Coloring Rules" dialog box</title>
      <graphic entityref="WiresharkColoringRulesDialog" format="PNG"/>
    </figure>
    <para>
      Once the Coloring Rules dialog box is up, there are a number
      of buttons you can use, depending on whether or not you have any
      color filters installed already.
    </para>
    <note><title>Note!</title>
	<para>
          You will need to carefully select the order the coloring rules are listed
          as they are applied in order from top to bottom.
	  So, more specific rules need to be listed before more general rules.
	  For example, if you have a color rule for UDP before the one for DNS,
	  the color rule for DNS will never be applied (as DNS uses UDP, so the
	  UDP rule will match first).
	</para>
    </note>
    <para>
	  If this is the first time you have used Coloring Rules, click on the New
	  button which will bring up the Edit color filter dialog box as shown in
      <xref linkend="ChCustEditColorDialog"/>.

    <para>
      In the Edit Color dialog box, simply enter a name for the color filter,
      and enter a filter string in the Filter text field.
      <xref linkend="ChCustEditColorDialog"/> shows the values
	<command>arp</command> and <command>arp</command> which means that
	the name of the color filter is <command>arp</command> and the filter
	will select protocols of type <command>arp</command>.  Once you have
	entered these values, you can choose a foreground and background
	color for packets that match the filter expression.  Click on
	<command>Foreground color...</command> or
	<command>Background color...</command> to achieve this and
	Wireshark will pop up the Choose foreground/background color for
	protocol dialog box as shown in
	<xref linkend="ChCustChooseColorDialog"/>.

    <para>

	filters being used in Wireshark. You may not like the color choices,
	however, feel free to choose your own.

	If you are uncertain which coloring rule actually took place for a
	specific packet, have a look at the [Coloring Rule Name: ...] and
	[Coloring Rule String: ...] fields.

  <section id="ChCustProtocolDissectionSection">
	<title>Control Protocol dissection</title>
	<para>
		The user can control how protocols are dissected.
	</para>
	<para>
		Each protocol has its own dissector, so dissecting a complete packet will
		typically involve several dissectors. As Wireshark tries to find the
		right dissector for each packet (using static "routes" and heuristics
		"guessing"), it might choose the wrong dissector in your specific
		case. For example, Wireshark won't know if you use a common protocol
		on an uncommon TCP port, e.g. using HTTP on TCP port 800 instead of
		the standard port 80.
	</para>
	<para>
		There are two ways to control the relations between protocol
		dissectors: disable a protocol dissector completely or temporarily
		divert the way Wireshark calls the dissectors.
	</para>
	<section id="ChAdvEnabledProtocols"><title>The "Enabled Protocols" dialog
	box</title>
	<para>
		The Enabled Protocols dialog box lets you enable or
		disable specific protocols; all protocols are enabled by default.
		When a protocol is disabled, Wireshark stops processing a packet
		whenever that protocol is encountered.
	</para>
	<note><title>Note!</title>
		<para>
		Disabling a protocol will prevent information about higher-layer
		protocols from being displayed.  For example,
		suppose you disabled the IP protocol and selected
		a packet containing Ethernet, IP, TCP, and HTTP
		information.  The Ethernet information would be
		displayed, but the IP, TCP and HTTP information
		would not - disabling IP would prevent it and
		the other protocols from being displayed.
		</para>
	</note>
        <para>
          To enable/disable protocols select the <command>Enabled Protocols...</command>
          item from the <command>Analyze</command> menu; Wireshark will pop up the "Enabled Protocols"
          dialog box as shown in <xref linkend="ChAdvEnabledProtocolsFig"/>.

		To disable or enable a protocol, simply click on it using the
		mouse or press the space bar when the protocol is highlighted.
                Note that typing the first few letters
                of the protocol name when the Enabled Protocols dialog box is active

	(ip.src == $2 and ip.dst == $1 and tcp.srcport == $4 and tcp.dstport == $3) ) </command>
	would allow to use a display filter like <command>${tcp_conv:10.1.1.2;10.1.1.3;1200;1400}</command>
	instead of typing the whole filter.

  <section id="ChObjectIdentifiers"><title>Object Identifiers</title>
  <para>
    Many protocols that use ASN.1 use Object Identifiers (OIDs) to uniquely identify certain pieces of information. In many cases, they are used in an extension mechanism so that new object identifiers (and associated values) may be defined without needing to change the base standard.
  </para>
  <para>
    Whilst Wireshark has knowledge about many of the OIDs and the syntax of their associated values, the extensibility means that other values may be encountered.
  </para>
  <para>
    Wireshark uses this table to allow the user to define the name and syntax of Object Identifiers that Wireshark does not know about (for example, a privately defined X.400 extension). It also allows the user to override the name and syntax of Object Identifiers that Wireshark does know about (e.g. changing the name "id-at-countryName" to just "c").
