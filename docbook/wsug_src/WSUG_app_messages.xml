  <title>Wireshark Messages</title>
  <para>
  Wireshark provides you with additional information generated out of 
  the plain packet data or it may need to indicate dissection problems.
  Messages generated by Wireshark are usually placed in [] parentheses.
  </para>
  <section id="AppMessagesList"><title>Packet List Messages</title>
    <para>
    These messages might appear in the packet list.
    </para>
  <section><title>[Malformed Packet]</title>
    <para>
    Malformed packet means that the protocol dissector can't dissect the 
    contents of the packet any further. There can be various reasons:
      <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <command>Wrong dissector</command>:
        Wireshark erroneously has chosen the wrong protocol dissector for 
        this packet. This will happen e.g. if you are using a protocol  
        not on its well known TCP or UDP port. You may try Analyze|Decode As 
        to circumvent this problem.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <command>Packet not reassembled</command>:
        The packet is longer than a single frame and it is not reassembled,
        see    <xref linkend="ChAdvReassemblySection"/> for further details.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <command>Packet is malformed</command>:
        The packet is actually wrong (malformed), meaning that a part of the 
        packet is just not as expected (not following the protocol 
        specifications).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <command>Dissector is buggy</command>:
        The corresponding protocol dissector is simply buggy or still
        incomplete.
      </para>
    </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
    Any of the above is possible. You'll have to look into the specific 
    situation to determine the reason. 
    You could disable the dissector by disabling the
    protocol on the Analyze menu and check how Wireshark displays the packet
    then. You could (if it's TCP) enable reassembly for TCP and the specific
    dissector (if possible) in the Edit|Preferences menu. You could check the
    packet contents yourself by reading the packet bytes and comparing it to
    the protocol specification. This could reveal a dissector bug. Or you
    could find out that the packet is indeed wrong.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section><title>[Packet size limited during capture]</title>
    <para>
    The packet size was limited during capture, see "Limit each packet to n 
    bytes" at the <xref linkend="ChCapCaptureOptions"/>. 
    While dissecting, the current protocol 
    dissector was simply running out of packet bytes and had to give up.
    There's nothing else you can do now, except to repeat the whole capture 
    process again with a higher (or no) packet size limitation.
    </para>

  <section id="AppMessagesDetails"><title>Packet Details Messages</title>
    <para>
    These messages might appear in the packet details.
    </para>
  <section><title>[Response in frame: 123]</title>
    <para>
    The current packet is the request of a detected request/response pair. 
    You can directly jump to the corresponding response packet just 
    by double clicking on this message.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section><title>[Request in frame: 123]</title>
    <para>
    Same as "Response in frame: 123" above, but the other way round.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section><title>[Time from request: 0.123 seconds]</title>
    <para>
    The time between the request and the response packets.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section><title>[Stream setup by PROTOCOL (frame 123)]</title>
    <para>
    The session control protocol (SDP, H225, etc) message which signaled 
    the creation of this session. You can directly jump to the 
    corresponding packet just by double clicking on this message.
