Dumpcap (Wireshark) 3.0.1 (v3.0.1rc0-3-g72c28bff)
Capture network packets and dump them into a pcapng or pcap file.
See https://www.wireshark.org for more information.

Usage: dumpcap [options] ...

Capture interface:
  -i <interface>           name or idx of interface (def: first non-loopback),
                           or for remote capturing, use one of these formats:
                               rpcap://<host>/<interface>
                               TCP@<host>:<port>
  -f <capture filter>      packet filter in libpcap filter syntax
  -s <snaplen>             packet snapshot length (def: appropriate maximum)
  -p                       don't capture in promiscuous mode
  -I                       capture in monitor mode, if available
  -B <buffer size>         size of kernel buffer in MiB (def: 2MiB)
  -y <link type>           link layer type (def: first appropriate)
  --time-stamp-type <type> timestamp method for interface
  -D                       print list of interfaces and exit
  -L                       print list of link-layer types of iface and exit
  --list-time-stamp-types  print list of timestamp types for iface and exit
  -d                       print generated BPF code for capture filter
  -k                       set channel on wifi interface:
                           <freq>,[<type>],[<center_freq1>],[<center_freq2>]
  -S                       print statistics for each interface once per second
  -M                       for -D, -L, and -S, produce machine-readable output

Stop conditions:
  -c <packet count>        stop after n packets (def: infinite)
  -a <autostop cond.> ...  duration:NUM - stop after NUM seconds
                           filesize:NUM - stop this file after NUM kB
                              files:NUM - stop after NUM files
                            packets:NUM - stop after NUM packets
Output (files):
  -w <filename>            name of file to save (def: tempfile)
  -g                       enable group read access on the output file(s)
  -b <ringbuffer opt.> ... duration:NUM - switch to next file after NUM secs
                           interval:NUM - create time intervals of NUM secs
                           filesize:NUM - switch to next file after NUM kB
                              files:NUM - ringbuffer: replace after NUM files
                            packets:NUM - ringbuffer: replace after NUM packets
  -n                       use pcapng format instead of pcap (default)
  -P                       use libpcap format instead of pcapng
  --capture-comment <comment>
                           add a capture comment to the output file
                           (only for pcapng)

Miscellaneous:
  -N <packet_limit>        maximum number of packets buffered within dumpcap
  -C <byte_limit>          maximum number of bytes used for buffering packets
                           within dumpcap
  -t                       use a separate thread per interface
  -q                       don't report packet capture counts
  -v                       print version information and exit
  -h                       display this help and exit

Dumpcap can benefit from an enabled BPF JIT compiler if available.
You might want to enable it by executing:
 "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable"
Note that this can make your system less secure!

Example: dumpcap -i eth0 -a duration:60 -w output.pcapng
"Capture packets from interface eth0 until 60s passed into output.pcapng"

Use Ctrl-C to stop capturing at any time.
