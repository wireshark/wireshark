Dumpcap (Wireshark) 3.7.2 (v3.7.2rc0-48-gd1f7aa5acb23)
Capture network packets and dump them into a pcapng or pcap file.
See https://www.wireshark.org for more information.

Usage: dumpcap [options] ...

Capture interface:
  -i <interface>, --interface <interface>
                           name or idx of interface (def: first non-loopback),
                           or for remote capturing, use one of these formats:
                               rpcap://<host>/<interface>
                               TCP@<host>:<port>
  --ifname <name>          name to use in the capture file for a pipe from which
                           we're capturing
  --ifdescr <description>
                           description to use in the capture file for a pipe

                           size of kernel buffer in MiB (def: 2MiB)
  -y <link type>, --linktype <link type>
                           link layer type (def: first appropriate)
  --time-stamp-type <type> timestamp method for interface
  -D, --list-interfaces    print list of interfaces and exit
  -L, --list-data-link-types
                           print list of link-layer types of iface and exit
  --list-time-stamp-types  print list of timestamp types for iface and exit
  -d                       print generated BPF code for capture filter
  -k <freq>,[<type>],[<center_freq1>],[<center_freq2>]
                           set channel on wifi interface
  -S                       print statistics for each interface once per second
  -M                       for -D, -L, and -S, produce machine-readable output

Stop conditions:
  -c <packet count>        stop after n packets (def: infinite)
  -a <autostop cond.> ..., --autostop <autostop cond.> ...
                           duration:NUM - stop after NUM seconds
                           filesize:NUM - stop this file after NUM kB
                              files:NUM - stop after NUM files
                            packets:NUM - stop after NUM packets
Output (files):
  -w <filename>            name of file to save (def: tempfile)
  -g                       enable group read access on the output file(s)
  -b <ringbuffer opt.> ..., --ring-buffer <ringbuffer opt.>
                           duration:NUM - switch to next file after NUM secs
                           filesize:NUM - switch to next file after NUM kB
                              files:NUM - ringbuffer: replace after NUM files
                            packets:NUM - ringbuffer: replace after NUM packets
                           interval:NUM - switch to next file when the time is
                                          an exact multiple of NUM secs
                          printname:FILE - print filename to FILE when written
                                           (can use 'stdout' or 'stderr')
  -n                       use pcapng format instead of pcap (default)
  -P                       use libpcap format instead of pcapng
  --capture-comment <comment>
                           add a capture comment to the output file
                           (only for pcapng)
  --temp-dir <directory>   write temporary files to this directory
                           (default: /tmp)

Diagnostic output:
  --log-level <level>      sets the active log level ("critical", "warning", etc.)
  --log-fatal <level>      sets level to abort the program ("critical" or "warning")
  --log-domains <[!]list>  comma separated list of the active log domains
  --log-debug <[!]list>    comma separated list of domains with "debug" level
  --log-noisy <[!]list>    comma separated list of domains with "noisy" level
  --log-file <path>        file to output messages to (in addition to stderr)

Miscellaneous:
  -N <packet_limit>        maximum number of packets buffered within dumpcap
  -C <byte_limit>          maximum number of bytes used for buffering packets
                           within dumpcap
  -t                       use a separate thread per interface
  -q                       don't report packet capture counts
  -v, --version            print version information and exit
  -h, --help               display this help and exit

Dumpcap can benefit from an enabled BPF JIT compiler if available.
You might want to enable it by executing:
 "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable"
Note that this can make your system less secure!

Example: dumpcap -i eth0 -a duration:60 -w output.pcapng
"Capture packets from interface eth0 until 60s passed into output.pcapng"

Use Ctrl-C to stop capturing at any time.
