    <title>What is <application>Wireshark?</application></title>
    <para>
    Wireshark is a network packet analyzer. A network packet
    analyzer will try to capture network packets and tries to display
    that packet data as detailed as possible.
    </para>
    <para>
    You could think of a network packet analyzer as a measuring device used to
    examine what's going on inside a network cable, just like a voltmeter is
    used by an electrician to examine what's going on inside an electric cable
    (but at a higher level, of course).
    </para>
    <para>
    In the past, such tools were either very expensive, proprietary, or both.
    However, with the advent of Wireshark, all that has changed.
    </para>
    <para>
    <application>Wireshark</application> is perhaps one of the best open
    source packet analyzers available today.
    </para>

  <section id="ChIntroPurposes"><title>Some intended purposes</title>

    <title>Live capture from many different network media</title>
    <para>
      Wireshark can capture traffic from many different network media types
      - and despite its name - including wireless LAN as well.
      Which media types are supported, depends on many things like the
      operating system you are using.
      An overview of the supported media types can be found at:

    <title>Many protocol decoders</title>
    <para>
      There are protocol decoders (or dissectors, as they are
      known in Wireshark) for a great many protocols:

    <section><title>Open Source Software</title>
    <para>
      Wireshark is an open source software project, and is released under
      the <ulink url="&GPLWebsite;">GNU General Public License</ulink> (GPL).
      You can freely use Wireshark on any number of computers you like, without
      worrying about license keys or fees or such. In addition, all source
      code is freely available under the GPL. Because of that, it is very easy
      for people to add new protocols to Wireshark, either as plugins, or built
      into the source, and they often do!
    </para>
    </section>

    <section id="ChIntroNoFeatures"><title>What Wireshark is not</title>
    <para>
    Here are some things Wireshark does not provide:
      <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
      Wireshark isn't an intrusion detection system.  It will not warn you when
      someone does strange things on your network that he/she isn't allowed to
      do. However, if strange things happen, Wireshark might help you figure
      out what is really going on.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
      Wireshark will not manipulate things on the network, it will only
      "measure" things from it. Wireshark doesn't send packets on the network
      or do other active things (except for name resolutions, but even
      that can be disabled).

    memory and disk space usage! For example: Capturing on a fully saturated
    100MBit/s Ethernet will produce ~ 750MBytes/min! Having a fast processor,
    lots of memory and disk space is a good idea in that case.</para></listitem>

    systems as time consuming tasks like filtering packets are single threaded.
    No rule is without exception: during an "Update list of packets in real
    time" capture, capturing traffic runs in one process and dissecting and
    displaying packets runs in another process - which should benefit from two

      Many older Windows versions are no longer supported for three reasons:
      None of the developers use those systems which makes support
      difficult. The libraries Wireshark depends on (GTK, WinPcap, …) have
      dropped support for older releases. Microsoft <ulink

  <section id="ChIntroHistory">
    <title>A brief history of Wireshark</title>
    <para>
      In late 1997, Gerald Combs needed a tool for tracking down
      networking problems and wanted to learn more about networking, so
      he started writing Ethereal (the former name of the Wireshark project)
      as a way to solve both problems.
    </para>
    <para>
      Ethereal was initially released, after several pauses in development,
      in July 1998 as version 0.2.0.  Within days, patches, bug reports,
      and words of encouragement started arriving, so Ethereal was on its
      way to success.
    </para>
    <para>
      Not long after that, Gilbert Ramirez saw its potential and contributed
      a low-level dissector to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      In October, 1998, Guy Harris of Network Appliance was looking for
      something better than tcpview, so he started applying patches and
      contributing dissectors to Ethereal.
    </para>
    <para>
      In late 1998, Richard Sharpe, who was giving TCP/IP courses, saw its
      potential on such courses, and started looking at it to see if it
      supported the protocols he needed. While it didn't at that point,
      new protocols could be easily added.  So he started contributing
      dissectors and contributing patches.
    </para>
    <para>
      The list of people who have contributed to the project has become very
      long since then, and almost all of them started with a protocol that they
      needed that Wireshark or Ethereal did not already handle. So they copied
      an existing dissector and contributed the code back to the team.
    </para>
    <para>
      In 2006 the project moved house and re-emerged under a new name: Wireshark.
    </para>
    <para>
      In 2008, after ten years of development, Wireshark finally arrived at
      version 1.0. This release was the first deemed complete, with the minimum
      features implemented. Its release coincided with the first Wireshark
      Developer and User Conference, called SharkFest.

      You can search in the list archives to see if someone asked the same
      question some time before and maybe already got an answer. That way you
      don't have to wait until someone answers your question.

    <para>
    Before reporting any problems, please make sure you have installed the
    latest version of Wireshark.
    </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      When reporting problems with Wireshark, it is helpful if you supply the
      following information:
      <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The version number of Wireshark and the dependent libraries linked with
        it, e.g. GTK+, etc. You can obtain this from the about dialog box
        of Wireshark, or with the command <command>wireshark -v</command>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Information about the platform you run Wireshark on.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        A detailed description of your problem.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If you get an error/warning message, copy the text of that message
        (and also a few lines before and after it, if there are some), so
        others may find the place where things go wrong. Please don't
        give something like: "I get a warning while doing x" as this won't
        give a good idea where to look at.
      </para>

    </para>
    <note><title>Don't send large files!</title>
    <para>
    Do not send large files (>100KB) to the mailing lists, just place a note
    that further data is available on request. Large files will only annoy a
    lot of people on the list who are not interested in your specific problem.
    If required, you will be asked for further data by the persons who really
    can help you.
    </para>
    </note>
    <warning><title>Don't send confidential information!</title>
    <para>
    If you send captured data to the mailing lists, be sure they don't contain
    any sensitive or confidential information like passwords or such.

    <section><title>Reporting Crashes on UNIX/Linux platforms</title>
    <para>
      When reporting crashes with Wireshark, it is helpful if you supply the
      traceback information (besides the information mentioned in "Reporting
      Problems").
    </para>
      <para>
        You can obtain this traceback information with the following commands:
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
$ gdb `whereis wireshark | cut -f2 -d: | cut -d' ' -f2` core >& bt.txt
backtrace
^D
$
]]>
        </programlisting>
        <note>
          <para>
        Type the characters in the first line verbatim! Those are
        back-tics there!
          </para>
        </note>
        <note>
          <para>
        backtrace is a <command>gdb</command> command. You should
        enter it verbatim after the first line shown above, but it will not be
        echoed. The ^D
        (Control-D, that is, press the Control key and the D key
        together) will cause <command>gdb</command> to exit. This will
        leave you with a file called
        <filename>bt.txt</filename> in the current directory.
        Include the file with your bug report.
          </para>
        </note>
        <note>
          <para>
        If you do not have <command>gdb</command> available, you
        will have to check out your operating system's debugger.
          </para>
        </note>
      </para>
      <para>
        You should mail the traceback to the
        <ulink url="mailto:&WiresharkDevMailList;">&WiresharkDevMailList;</ulink>
        mailing list.
      </para>
  </section>

    <section><title>Reporting Crashes on Windows platforms</title>
    <para>
    The Windows distributions don't contain the symbol files (.pdb), because
    they are very large. For this reason it's not possible to create
    a meaningful backtrace file from it. You should report your crash just
    like other problems, using the mechanism described above.
