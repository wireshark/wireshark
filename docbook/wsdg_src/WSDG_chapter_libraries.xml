	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
	Several libraries are needed to build / run Wireshark. Most of the
	libraries are splitted into three packages:
	<orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	Runtime package: binaries (e.g. win32 DLL's) and alike
	</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	Developer package: documentation, header files and alike
	</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	Source package: library sources, usually not required to
	build Wireshark
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	<tip><title>Tip!</title>
	<para>
	Win32: All required libraries for the MSVC
	generation are available at: 
	<ulink	url="http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark-win32-libs/trunk/packages/"/>,
	but see <xref linkend="ChLibsSetup"/> for an easier way to install the 
	libraries.
	</para>
	</tip>
	</para>
  </section>
	
  <section id="ChLibsFormat">
    <title>Binary library formats</title>
	<para>
	Binary libraries are available in different formats, depending on the C 
	compiler (see <xref linkend="ChToolsCompiler"/>) used to build it and of 
	course the platform they were build for.
	</para>
	
	<section id="ChLibsFormatUnix">
	<title>Unix</title>
	<para>
	If you have installed unix binary libraries on your system, they will 
	match the C compiler. If not already installed, the libraries should be
	available as a package from the platform installer, or you can download
	and compile the source and install that binaries then.
	</para>
	</section>

	<section id="ChLibsFormatWin32MSVC6">
	<title>Win32: MSVC V6</title>
	<para>
	Recommended for current Win32 Wireshark releases.
	Most of the Win32 binary libraries you will find on the web are in this
	format. You will recognize MSVC libraries by the .lib/.dll file extension.
	</para>
	</section>

	<section id="ChLibsFormatWin32MSVC2003">
	<title>Win32: MSVC 2003</title>
	<para>
	Currently not widely available, but the first libraries in that format can 
	be seen on the web. These libraries have the same .lib/.dll file 
	extension, but unfortunately they are not completely compatible as they 
	are linked with different dependant libraries, see <xref 
	linkend="ChToolsCompiler"/> for some further explanations.
	</para>
	</section>

	<section id="ChLibsFormatWin32Cygwin">
	<title>Win32: cygwin gcc</title>
	<para>
	Cygwin provides most of the required libraries (with file extension .a/.lib) 
	for Wireshark suitable for cygwin's gcc compiler.
	</para>
	</section>
  </section>
	
  <section id="ChLibsSetup">
	<title>Win32: Automated library download</title>
	<para>
	You can download/install all required libraries by using the setup target 
	of the <filename>Makefile.nmake</filename> from the source package.
	</para>
	<tip><title>Tip!</title>
	<para>
	It's a really good idea to use the Win32 automated library download to 
	install the required libraries as it makes this download very easy.
	</para>
	</tip>
	<note><title>Note!</title>
	<para>
	Before you start the download, you must have installed both
	the required tools (see <xref linkend="ChapterTools"/>) and also the 
	Wireshark sources (see <xref linkend="ChSrcObtain"/>).
	</para>
	</note>
	<para>
	By default the libraries will be downloaded and installed into 
	<filename>C:\wireshark-win32-libs</filename>.
	You can change this to any other location by editing the file
	<filename>config.nmake</filename> and changing the line containing 
	the WIRESHARK_LIBS setting to your favourite place (use an absolute path 
	here).
	</para>
	<para>
	Then enter at the command line:
	</para>
	<para>
	<prompt>&gt;</prompt> <userinput>nmake -f Makefile.nmake setup</userinput>
	</para>
	<para>
	This will first check for all the various tools needed to build Wireshark,
	as described already in <xref linkend="ChToolsWin32Verify"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
	Then it will download the zipped libraries into the directory specified by 
	WIRESHARK_LIBS and install (unzip) all required library files there.
	</para>
	<para>
	If you have problems downloading the library files, see the wget proxy 
	comment in <xref linkend="ChToolsWget"/>.
	</para>

	<section id="ChLibsSetupUpdate">
	<title>Update of a previous download</title>
	<para>
	As new versions of the libraries become available, maybe with bugfixes or
	some new functionality, your libraries get outdated.
	</para>
	<para>
	You could simply remove everything in the WIRESHARK_LIBS dir and call the 
	setup target again, but that would require to download every file again 
	(currently about 33MB), which isn't necessary.
	</para>
	<para>
	The following will bring your libraries up to date:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	Update your Wireshark sources to the latest SVN files (see <xref 
	linkend="ChSrcObtain"/>), so the zip filenames in the setup target 
	of Makefile.nmake is in sync with the library zip files on the server.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>	
	Remove all files previously unzipped from the downloaded files in your 
	WIRESHARK_LIBS library path (all the subdirs, e.g. 
	<filename>c:\wireshark-win32-libs\gtk+</filename>), 
	except for the zip files located at the toplevel, which are the files 
	downloaded the last time(s). You could do this, be entering at the command line:
	</para>
	<para>
	<prompt>&gt;</prompt> <userinput>nmake -f Makefile.nmake clean_setup</userinput>
	</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>
	Start the setup target described above. As wget will download only the 
	missing files, existing zip files in the WIRESHARK_LIBS dir won't be 
	downloaded again. Remaining (outdated) zip files shouldn't do any harm.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

  <section id="ChLibsGtk">
	<title>GTK+ / GLib / GDK / Pango / ATK / GNU gettext / GNU libiconv</title>
	<para>
	The Glib library is used as a basic platform abstraction library, it's 
	not related to graphical user interface (GUI) things. For a detailed 
	description about GLib, see <xref linkend="ChCodeGLib"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
	The GTK and it's dependant libraries are used to build Wireshark's GUI. 
	For a detailed description of the GTK libraries, see <xref 
	linkend="ChUIGTK"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
	All other libraries are dependant on the two libraries mentioned above, 
	you will typically not come in touch with these while doing Wireshark 
	development. 
	</para>
	<para>
	As the requirements for the GLib/GTK libraries increased in the past, it 
	depends on the GLib/GTK versions you have, which additional libraries are 
	required. The 1.x versions only needed GLib/GDK/GTK+, while the 2.x 
	versions require all mentioned libs.
	</para>

	<section id="ChLibsUnixGTK">
	<title>Unix</title>
	<para>
	The GLib/GTK+ libraries are available for many unix-like platforms and 
	cygwin.
	</para>
	<para>

	package for your platform, you can get them at:
