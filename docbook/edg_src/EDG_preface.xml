	This book tries to give you a guide to start your own experiments into 
	the wonderful world of Ethereal development.
  </para>
  <para>
	Developers who are new to Ethereal are often having a hard time getting 
	their development environment up and running. This is
	especially true for Win32 developers, as a lot of the tools and methods
	used when building Ethereal are much more common in the UNIX world than
	on Win32.
  </para>
  <para>
	The first part of this book will describe how to set up the environment 
	needed to develop Ethereal.
  </para>
  <para>
	The second part of this book will describe how to change the Ethereal 
	source code.
