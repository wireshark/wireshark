	<para>
	This chapter will provide you with information how to install 
	the various tools needed for Ethereal development.
	</para>
	<para>
	None of the tools mentioned in this chapter is needed to run Ethereal,
	they are only needed to build it.
	</para>
	<para>
	All these tools have
	their roots on UNIX like platforms, but Win32 ports are also
	available. Therefore the tools are available in different "flavours":
	<itemizedlist>
  	<listitem>
	<para>
	UNIX: as described above, the tools should be commonly available on the
	supported UNIX platforms, and for Win32 platforms by the Cygwin UNIX 
	emulation
	</para>
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
	<para>
	Win32 native: some tools are available as native Win32 tools, no 
	emulation is required
	</para>
  	</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
	The following sections give a very brief description of 
	what the particular tool is doing, how it is used in the Ethereal project 
	and how it can be installed and tested.
	</para>
	<para>
	Don't expect a lot of documentation regarding these tools in this
	document. If you need further documentation of a specific tool, you
	should find lot's of useful information on the web, as these tools are
	commonly used. As all of the tools are command line tools, you can try 
	to get help with <userinput>toolname --help</userinput> or read
	the manpage <userinput>man toolname</userinput>.
	</para>
	<para>
	You will find explanations of the tool usage for some of the specific 
	development tasks in <xref linkend="ChapterSources"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
	Some recommendations are given for the
	easiest way to get a Win32 development platform up and running, see 
	<xref linkend="ChToolsWin32Recommended"/>.
	</para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="ChToolsInstall">
	<title>Installation</title>
	<para>
	The installation of the tools depend on the platform you use:
	</para>
	
	<section id="ChToolsInstallUnix">
	<title>UNIX</title>
	<para>
	All the tools required are usually installed on a UNIX developer machine.
	</para>
	<para>
	If a tool is not already installed on your system, you will typically use 
	the installation package from your distribution.
	</para>
	<para>
	If an install package is not available, or you have a reason not to use 
	it (maybe because it's simply too old), you can install that tool 
	from source code. The following sections will provide you with the webpage
	addresses where you can get these sources. 
	</para>
	</section>
	
	<section id="ChToolsInstallWin32Native">
	<title>Win32 native</title>
	<para>
	The native tools will typically be a bit faster, but more complicated to 
	install. You will have to download a lot of tools from different webpages, 
	and install them in the ways they have to be installed. The default 
	installation location will typically not be the 
	<filename>C:\Program Files</filename> folder. Have a look at 
	<xref linkend="ChToolsWin32Recommended"/> for an overview of the 
	recommended tools.
	</para>
	</section>
	
	<section id="ChToolsInstallCygwin">
	<title>Win32 Cygwin</title>
	<para>
	Installation of the Cygwin tools is very simple. As Cygwin uses an 
	UNIX emulation layer,
	it might be a bit slower compared to the native tools, but at an 
	acceptable level. All tools will be installed into one base folder, the 
	default is <filename>C:\cygwin</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	Cygwin provides a UNIX emulation layer with a lot of UNIX based tools
	on the Win32 platform. Although Cygwin consists of several
	seperate packages, the installation and update is done through a
	single setup.exe, which acts similar to other web based installers.
	</para>
	<para>
	You will find this network based setup.exe at: <ulink 
	url="http://www.cygwin.com/"/>. Click on one
	of the "Install Cygwin now" appearances. This will start the download
	of the setup.exe.
	</para>
	<para>
	After the download completed, start this setup.exe on your machine. It
	will ask you for some
	settings, the defaults should usually work well. The setup will
	then download and install a basic set of packages.
	</para>
	<para>
	Under: "Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Cygwin -&gt; Cygwin Bash Shell" you
	should now be able to start a new Cygwin bash shell, which is similar to 
	the command line (command.exe/cmd.exe) in Win32, but much more powerful.
	</para>
	<para>
	If you want to add additional, update installed or remove packages, you 
	should start the setup.exe again. At the "Select Packages" page, the 
	entry in the "New" column will control what is done (or not) with the 
	package. If a new version of a package is available, the new version 
	number will be displayed, so it will be automatically updated. You can 
	change the current setting by simply clicking at it, it will change 
	between:
	<itemizedlist>

	<para>
	a specific version number - this different package version will be 
	installed

	It is reported that this compiler requires to ship a MSVCRT70.dll together

	conflicts, as all required libraries currently compiled with (and uses) 
	MSVCRT.dll (the older version 6 one). 
	</para>
	<para>
	Example why this hurts: A dependant library might try to open a file using 
	functions in MSVCRT.dll which creates an internal file handle and keeps 
	information about that file. When Ethereal tries to read data from that 
	file, it uses the functions from MSVCRT70.dll, which doesn't know anything 
	about that previously opened file and returns an error code.

	Unfortunately, the link command is defined both from cygwin and from MSVC 
	with completely different purpose, you'll need the MSVC link. 
	If your link command looks something like: /usr/bin/link, the link command 
	of cygwin takes precedence over the MSVC one. To fix this, you can change 
	your PATH environment setting or simply renaming the link.exe in cygwin. 
	If you rename it, make sure to remember that a cygwin update may provide 
	a new version of it.
