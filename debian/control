Description: dummy upgrade package for ethereal -> wireshark
 Wireshark is a network traffic analyzer, or "sniffer", for Unix and
 Unix-like operating systems. A sniffer is a tool used to capture 
 packets off the wire. Wireshark decodes numerous protocols (too many

 It was previously named ethereal.  This is a transitional package
 so ethereal users get wireshark on upgrades.  This package handles
 ethereal-common -> wireshark-common.  It can be safely removed.
