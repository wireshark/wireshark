The REAMDE specific to the Wireshark "copy" of the pidl sources
==============================================================

The tree tools/pidl is a direct extract from
svn://svnanon.samba.org/samba/branches/SAMBA_4_0/source/pidl
to allow building Wireshark pidl dissectors without having to
*explicitely* access a remote svn repository.

Don't do changes here, do them at the samba tree! Changes to this tree will
be overwritten the next time the sources from the samba tree are updated,
which is basically every time you do an svn up in the Wireshark toplevel dir.

In order to build, install yapp (on Suse, the rpm is named perl-Parse-Yapp),
then do
make Makefile.PL && make && && make install

This will build and install the binaries and the manpage (pidl.1).

run  pidl with:

pidl --eth-parser -- <idl-file>  (don't forget the "--")

If you run outside the dissectors/pidl directory, this *will* result in a
warning like:
atsvc.idl:5:23: idl_types.h: No such file or directory
and *may* result in additional warnings like:
Warning: No conformance file `initshutdown.cnf'
