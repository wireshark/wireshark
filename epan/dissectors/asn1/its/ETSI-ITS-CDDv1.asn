 * - `102` if the confidence value is unavailable.
 *
 * The value 0 shall not be used.
 *
 * @note: The fact that an acceleration value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(102)` can be caused by several reasons, such as:
 * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
 * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
 * In all 3 cases above, the acceleration value may be valid and used by the application.

 * @note: If an acceleration value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(101)`, it means that the value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful for the application.

 * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
 * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
 * In all 3 cases above, the curvature value may be valid and used by the application.
 * 
 * @note: If a curvature value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(6)`, it means that the curvature value is not valid
