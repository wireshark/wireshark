         The data contains arbitrary data of variable length. Unless
         otherwise noted, the AVP Length field MUST be set to at least 9
         (13 if the 'V' bit is enabled).  Data used to transmit (human
         readable) character string data uses the UTF-8 [24] character
         set and is NOT NULL-terminated. The minimum Length field MUST
         be 9, but can be set to any value up to 65504 bytes. AVP Values
         of this type that do not align on a 32-bit boundary MUST have
         the necessary padding.
	 -->
		<typedefn type-name="UTF8String" type-parent="OctetString"/>
		<!--
         The UTF8String format is derived from the OctetString AVP Base
         Format. This is a human readable string represented using the
         ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an OctetString
         using the UTF-8 [29] transformation format described in RFC
         2279.

         Since additional code points are added by amendments to the
         10646 standard from time to time, implementations MUST be
         prepared to encounter any code point from 0x00000001 to
         0x7fffffff. Byte sequences that do not correspond to the valid
         UTF-8 encoding of a code point or are outside this range are
         prohibited. Note that since a code point of 0x00000000 is
         prohibited, no octet will contain a value of 0x00.

         The use of control codes SHOULD be avoided. When it is
         necessary to represent a newline, the control code sequence CR
         LF SHOULD be used.

         The use of leading or trailing white space SHOULD be avoided.

         For code points not directly supported by user interface
         hardware or software, an alternative means of entry and
         display, such as hexadecimal, MAY be provided.

         For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8 encoding
         is identical to the US-ASCII encoding.

         UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a single
         character / code point; thus the length of a UTF8String in
         octets may be different from the number of characters encoded.

         Note that the size of an UTF8String is measured in octets, not
         characters.

         The UTF8String MUST not contain any octets with a value of
         zero.
        -->
		<typedefn type-name="IPAddress" type-parent="OctetString"/>
		<!--
         The IPAddress format is derived from the OctetString AVP Base
         Format. It represents 32 bit (IPv4) [17] or 128 bit (IPv6) [16]
         address, most significant octet first. The format of the
         address (IPv4 or IPv6) is determined by the length. If the
         attribute value is an IPv4 address, the AVP Length field MUST
         be 12 (16 if 'V' bit is enabled), otherwise the AVP Length
         field MUST be set to 24 (28 if the 'V' bit is enabled) for IPv6
         addresses.

		<typedefn type-name="DiameterIdentity" type-parent="OctetString"/>
		<!--
         The DiameterIdentity format is derived from the OctetString AVP
         Base Format.  It uses the UTF-8 encoding and has the same
         requirements as the UTF8String.  In addition, it must follow
         the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) syntax [29] rules
         specified below:

            Diameter-Identity  = fqdn [ port ] [ transport ]
                                 [ protocol ]

            aaa-protocol       = ( "diameter" | "radius" | "tacacs+" )

            protocol           = ";protocol=" aaa-protocol
                                 ; If absent, the default AAA protocol
                                 ; is diameter.

            fqdn               = Fully Qualified Host Name

            port               = ":" 1*DIGIT
                                 ; One of the ports used to listen for
                                 ; incoming connections. ; If absent,
                                 ; the default Diameter port (TBD) is
                                 ; assumed.

            transport-protocol = ( "tcp" | "sctp" | "udp" )

            transport          = ";transport=" transport-protocol

                                 ; One of the transports used to listen
                                 ; for incoming connections. If absent,
                                 ; the default SCTP [26] protocol is
                                 ; assumed. UDP MUST NOT be used when
                                 ; the aaa-protocol field is set to
                                 ; diameter.

            The following are examples of valid Diameter host
            identities:

               host.abc.com;transport=tcp
               host.abc.com:6666;transport=tcp
               aaa://host.abc.com;protocol=diameter
               aaa://host.abc.com:6666;protocol=diameter
               aaa://host.abc.com:6666;transport=tcp;protocol=diameter
               aaa://host.abc.com:1813;transport=udp;protocol=radius

         Since multiple Diameter processes on a single host cannot
         listen for incoming connections on the same port on a given
         protocol, the DiameterIdentity is guaranteed to be unique per
         host.

         A Diameter node MAY advertise different identities on each
         connection, via the CER and CEA's Origin-Host AVP, but the same
         identity MUST be used throughout the duration of a connection.

         When comparing AVPs of this format, it is necessary to add any
         absent fields with the default values prior to the comparison.
         For example, diameter-host.abc.com would be expanded to
         aaa://diameter/diameter-host.abc.com:TBD;protocol=sctp.

		<typedefn type-name="IPFilterRule" type-parent="OctetString"/>
		<!--
         The IPFilterRule format is derived from the OctetString AVP
         Base Format.  It uses the UTF-8 encoding and has the same
         requirements as the UTF8String. Packets may be filtered based
         on the following information that is associated with it:

            Direction                          (in or out)
            Source and destination IP address  (possibly masked)
            Protocol
            Source and destination port        (lists or ranges)
            TCP flags
            IP fragment flag
            IP options
            ICMP types

         Rules for the appropriate direction are evaluated in order,
         with the first matched rule terminating the evaluation.  Each
         packet is evaluated once. If no rule matches, the packet is
         dropped if the last rule evaluated was a permit, and passed if
         the last rule was a deny.

         IPFilterRule filters MUST follow the format:

            action dir proto from src to dst [options]

            action       permit - Allow packets that match the rule.
                         deny   - Drop packets that match the rule.

            dir          "in" is from the terminal, "out" is to the
                         terminal.

            proto        An IP protocol specified by number.  The "ip"
                         keyword means any protocol will match.

            src and dst  <address/mask> [ports]

                         The <address/mask> may be specified as:
                         ipno       An IPv4 or IPv6 number in dotted-
                                    quad or canonical IPv6 form. Only
                                    this exact IP number will match the
                                    rule.
                         ipno/bits  An IP number as above with a mask
                                    width of the form 1.2.3.4/24.  In
                                    this case all IP numbers from
                                    1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255 will match.
                                    The bit width MUST be valid for the
                                    IP version and the IP number MUST
                                    NOT have bits set beyond the mask.

                         The sense of the match can be inverted by
                         preceding an address with the not modifier,
                         causing all other addresses to be matched
                         instead.  This does not affect the selection of
                         port numbers.

                            The keyword "any" is 0.0.0.0/0 or the IPv6
                            equivalent.  The keyword "assigned" is the
                            address or set of addresses assigned to the
                            terminal.  The first rule SHOULD be "deny in
                            ip !assigned".

                         With the TCP, UDP and SCTP protocols, optional
                         ports may be specified as:

                            {port|port-port}[,port[,...]]

                         The `-' notation specifies a range of ports
                         (including boundaries).

                         Fragmented packets which have a non-zero offset
                         (i.e. not the first fragment) will never match
                         a rule which has one or more port
                         specifications.  See the frag option for
                         details on matching fragmented packets.

            options:
               frag    Match if the packet is a fragment and this is not
                       the first fragment of the datagram.  frag may not
                       be used in conjunction with either tcpflags or
                       TCP/UDP port specifications.

               ipoptions spec
                       Match if the IP header contains the comma
                       separated list of options specified in spec. The
                       supported IP options are:

                       ssrr (strict source route), lsrr (loose source
                       route), rr (record packet route) and ts
                       (timestamp). The absence of a particular option
                       may be denoted with a `!'.

               tcpoptions spec
                       Match if the TCP header contains the comma
                       separated list of options specified in spec. The
                       supported TCP options are:

                       mss (maximum segment size), window (tcp window
                       advertisement), sack (selective ack), ts (rfc1323
                       timestamp) and cc (rfc1644 t/tcp connection
                       count).  The absence of a particular option may
                       be denoted with a `!'.

               established
                       TCP packets only. Match packets that have the RST
                       or ACK bits set.

               setup   TCP packets only. Match packets that have the SYN
                       bit set but no ACK bit.

               tcpflags spec
                       TCP packets only. Match if the TCP header
                       contains the comma separated list of flags
                       specified in spec. The supported TCP flags are:

                       fin, syn, rst, psh, ack and urg. The absence of a
                       particular flag may be denoted with a `!'. A rule
                       which contains a tcpflags specification can never
                       match a fragmented packet which has a non-zero
                       offset.  See the frag option for details on
                       matching fragmented packets.

               icmptypes types
                       ICMP packets only.  Match if the ICMP type is in
                       the list types. The list may be specified as any
                       combination of ranges or individual types
                       separated by commas.  The supported ICMP types
                       are:

                       echo reply (0), destination unreachable (3),
                       source quench (4), redirect (5), echo request
                       (8), router advertisement (9), router
                       solicitation (10), time-to-live exceeded (11), IP
                       header bad (12), timestamp request (13),
                       timestamp reply (14), information request (15),
                       information reply (16), address mask request (17)
                       and address mask reply (18).

         There is one kind of packet that the access device MUST always
         discard, that is an IP fragment with a fragment offset of one.
         This is a valid packet, but it only has one use, to try to
         circumvent firewalls.

            An access device that is unable to interpret or apply a deny
            rule MUST terminate the session.  An access device that is
            unable to interpret or apply a permit rule MAY apply a more
            restrictive rule.  An access device MAY apply deny rules of
            its own before the supplied rules, for example to protect
            the access device owner's infrastructure.

         The rule syntax is a modified subset of ipfw(8) from FreeBSD,
         and the ipfw.c code may provide a useful base for
         implementations.

                         ipno/bits  An IP number as above with a mask
                                    width of the form 1.2.3.4/24.  In
                                    this case all IP numbers from
                                    1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255 will match.
                                    The bit width MUST be valid for the
                                    IP version and the IP number MUST
                                    NOT have bits set beyond the mask.

                         The sense of the match can be inverted by
                         preceding an address with the not modifier,
                         causing all other addresses to be matched
                         instead.  This does not affect the selection of
                         port numbers.

                            The keyword "any" is 0.0.0.0/0 or the IPv6
                            equivalent.  The keyword "assigned" is the
                            address or set of addresses assigned to the
                            terminal.  The first rule SHOULD be "deny in
                            ip !assigned".

                         With the TCP, UDP and SCTP protocols, optional
                         ports may be specified as:

                            {port|port-port}[,port[,...]]

                         The `-' notation specifies a range of ports
                         (including boundaries).

            options:

               DSCP <color>
                       color values as defined in [49]. Exact matching
                       of DSCP values is required (no masks or ranges).
                       the "deny" can replace the color_under or
                       color_over values in the meter action for rate-
                       dependent packet drop.

               metering <rate> <color_under> <color_over>
                       The metering option provides Assured Forwarding,
                       as defined in [50], and MUST be present if the
                       action is set to meter. The rate option is the
                       throughput, in bits per second, which is used by
                       the access device to mark packets. Traffic above
                       the rate is marked with the color_over codepoint,
                       while traffic under the rate is marked with the
                       color_under codepoint. The color_under and
                       color_over options contain the drop preferences,
                       and MUST conform to the recommended codepoint
                       keywords described in [50] (e.g. AF13).

                       The metering option also supports the strict
                       limit on traffic required by Expedited
                       Forwarding, as defined in [51]. The color_over
                       option may contain the keyword "drop" to prevent
                       forwarding of traffic that exceeds the rate
                       parameter.

         The rule syntax is a modified subset of ipfw(8) from FreeBSD,
         and the ipfw.c code may provide a useful base for
         implementations.
