 * This is not a complete implementation. It doesn't handle the full version 3, more specifically,
 * it handles only the commands of version 2, but any additional characteristics of the ver3 command are supported.
 * It's also missing extensible search filters.
 *
 * There should probably be alot more error checking, I simply assume that if we have a full packet, it will be a complete
 * and correct packet.
 *
 * AFAIK, it will handle all messages used by the OpenLDAP 1.2.9 server and libraries which was my goal. I do plan to add
 * the remaining commands as time permits but this is not a priority to me. Send me an email if you need it and I'll see what
 * I can do.
