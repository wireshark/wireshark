# Source files are divided up along several axes:
#
# C vs. C++ - this is used on Windows to generated lists of object files
# with .c=.obj or .cpp=.obj
#
# Register vs. non-register - register files are scanned for registration
# functions, non-register files aren't.
#
# Flex-generated, Lemon-generated, and non-generated:
#
#	we distribute non-generated files, as they're part of the source,
#	and distribute Flex-generated files, as we don't require that
#	people have Flex installed and don't distribute it ourself and
#	thus can't guarantee that we can run Flex in the build process,
#	but we don't distribute Lemon-generated files, as we distribute
#	Lemon and can run it in the build process;
#
#	"make maintainer-clean" on UN*X and "nmake maintainer-clean" on
#	Windows remove all generated files;
#
#	"make distclean" on UN*X removes Lemon-generated files, as they're
#	not in the distribution, but not Flex-generated files, as they
#	are in the distribution;
#
#	"make distclean" on Windows removes both Lemon-generated and
#	Flex-generated files, as the Flex-generated files in the
#	distribution were generated by Flex on UN*X, and won't compile
#	on Windows;
#
#	Flex-generated files can't be built with full warnings
#	turned on, and can't be run through the checkAPI scripts,
#	as they generate code that won't pass (we've tweaked
#	Lemon to generate code that will pass).
